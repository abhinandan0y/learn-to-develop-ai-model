MERRY MODE
Turn round round like a merry goes
Filling up my heart and empty soul
Fertile and plant knowledge to grow
That how I see it so you should know
Never old hippy hippy in merry mode
Reason never sinking float go aboard
The people singing welcome onboard
Dance and clinking toast to happy end
Sail on cloud, the dark and the bright
There's nothing like night, eyes wide
Cîroc and lime, a little for the shock
Opening lock time's secure and kept
Merry men proposal sent return cash
One to never end, the baking of bread
1END
Creeping in the wild, destination far
Vocals loud but there is no one near
Look left, right stuck at roundabout
Passion bound to fulfill written lines
Track; find skill made from the mind
What end? Challenge thrown in ditch
The world bend man can't be straight
Life round, square hole for angle peg
Ambition to blend paving historical
Battle defeat, at end standing so tall
Like the Burj seen from distant lands
Riding on cloud soar on eagles wave
Mortals, one day we all come to end
Legacies kept running winning time
2RAVEN’S PARK
Flying high in the sky cos I'm a bird
Lens reaches far finding fruit of life
Scare crow mountain roar like a god
Perfect flight land and strike one all
Battle line prey fight still I stand tall
From one day till the night and I ball
Mission ringing and I'm picking call
A vision leading to espirits de core
Living in the blue moving with cloud
Scanning for view, monetary bound
Old feathers turn new, wash offline
Making brand clue, reap is of time
Raven's Park rooftop sitting and talk
Moments will inform a place to stalk
3LEGEND
Sacrifice to find knowledge, I search
Digging deep in soil, brain stale kept
Clay to form, breathless but in-depth
Generations to inform as one is rare
Ascend stair in regalia, royal robe on
Nature is aware, for a legend is born
Mental strong calm in thunder storm
Wisdom to pour into mortal turn ore
Feast till fall of Sun, merriment stun
Defending all, for my legend is shield
Tears of joy as mural hanging on wall
Clock's done and remembrance comes
Along the journey, taste may be sour
Activating legendary, for man is god
4LOST
Form from dust, man is made in lust
Rainfall, mind is pushed against wall
Mount up strong never lost in garden
Birth in Eden, for flowers is all over
Pitfall, the wise crosses to other side
Renegade, many have taken old path
Spirit man serenade showing lifeline
Draught time to lessen mind burden
Lost to be found on heavenly journey
Streamline and resolute nothing dither
Like arrow successful thru needle eye
In power of the tongue, words is flesh
Moving benign and healing all scars
Breeding new gene, man is not lost
5HASTY
Speeding vehicles along the freeway
Rising molecules, an exonerating air
Medicare, rushing for a dental brace
Man is lay, experience inform therein
Hasty? One day light will be turned on
Appearing different time fixed in place
Vocal and making art, porter in space
Unique is everyone, it shows in phase
Racing in May and meet up the year
Carriage sway milk steel can't break
A happy feel Instill it's burning desire
Lighting the fire clouds striking earth
Hastily, moving than speed of sights
In years to come fill colors of the eye
6BACK G ROAD
Still to go many miles on the road
Of many lies, and the battle crows
From bottom to dome and many fly
Super heroes soaring up in the sky
Traveling sowing seeds on the road
And plant my soul at back gee road
Through more pains and scary rain
Lifting whole and becomes strong
Then I realize life's been always so
Some fingers taller some stay low
Making music, like marshmallow
Hidden faces, train ride to the sun
It comes gushing, light at the end
Survival, now on mainstream road
7CIRCLES
In circles life keeps turning around
Like sinusoidal I'm floating on curve
Spinning in time, merry going round
Notes of flavors in circle to perfume
Singing song from ancient till dawn
Moving vertically, steps like a pawn
Karma once gone, in good it return
Circles of air leading to the ground
Pleasures ring around form spring
Solar po'er to move mountain step
Ascending and birth a new genius
From atmosphere to earth inferno
Circle of known ways breeding all
Eyes on the core, a dynamic world
8VANISH
Struggles on earth meet calm of cloud
Walking on land to vanish underground
Looking beyond the line, eyesight blurs
Moment arrive all thing become vanity
Green of the grass along the hilly road
Through summer, winter sheds leaves
Mountains tall like seed on the ground
Mirage in front, still travel into vanish
Imperfectness makes us all mortals
Journey to vanity is destiny of us all
Legacy to last far beyond vanquish
Stamped footprint on road to vanity
Brain to inherit, knowledge to plant
Into generation who travel to vanity
9FEEL
Rubber needs elastic mind money fill
Bending knees humble tap, man feel
Enroute growth, many puddles on hill
To overcome into better days '&' heal
Building banks, let in ideas and keep
Helium air, words lift through scene
On screen, the visuals print to show
What I feel from deep down my soul
For freedom in society burying of ill
Safe for all being, resource for each
Own roof for peaceful sleep all time
Government good, young to be star
To never giving up working always
Art of life to feel in my city so real
10OVER THE RAINBOW
Shooting star flying over the rainbow
Block of life building bricks like Lego
Up in the sky see in multi dimension
No black, white for life is many color
Gliding over time script roll in lenses
Giving a proper view in correct tense
Pressure arise to propel o'er rainbow
Victory sight, ball dance in main bowl
Burning all root growing seed of ego
Soaring up in sky oh yes I'm an eagle
Radiating, with curve and streamline
Story never fades, stored in real time
Magic’s each phase over the rainbow
Bringing happy face, reward of labor
11GOLD LOCKET
Planted feet, shaking tree not moved
A suckling Kin receive milk of history
Through mother feed grooming clean
Grow in speed God made gold locket
Human to feel, grass green blood red
Pigment of skin, a little injury it swell
Pore to be filled with bump of goose
Emotion to reveal, gold raw in locket
Love in my pocket, sermon I preach
Thin is toughest, finding long reach
Smelt and purify to increase mindly
Using the key to open locket vividly
Bullion of bars, knowledge is gold
Value of the star kept in my locket
12GREEN
Greasly economy waxing up strong
Freezing illicit, let good one sprung
End of deceit, chorus to sing along
Better years keeping climate green
Fishing in the creeks, a city Venice
Culture and tales of Victor Hermès
Through the storm, wind he chase
Battle against evil result is success
Planting more trees time to spring
Triple jumping to distant hectares
Abundant resource natural deposit
Future years is green machine drill
Measurements and mix cognitive
Like mind single fit in one nation
13GRIZZLY
Cold feet walking on snow downtown
Going unto sunrise setting at summer
Twist next surprises come on big flex
Written text, color to bear it all grizzly
Facing ferocious, two step move side
Juxtaposition, fall roll down hay side
Outskirts of country land, a cry echo
Sound deep in the night moon shine
It all appears bare, a battle for survival
Twinning makes fur, keep warm in cold
Royal blood rumble bear back on floor
Baking new score for Victoria Ascerta
Big claws striking time keeping stride
Create prints on sand and ocean tide
14SLINGSHOT
Momentum pulled back gaining power
Butterfly sucking cross budding flower
Thrusting further, arrow on future flight
Sling of shot reaching maximum sight
Monetary blights every place on planet
Physically right, Bounce off-white wall
Align fault, take me to time of couture
Designer shot, sipping and want more
Tango on, dancing making steps sour
Memory loss, at castle made of sand
Crumbled tour, moving in circus form
Hippy shot, emotions they sling away
Really course, on path to secret dust
Flinging four, shot of emotions pour
15SIGMA
Waiting for a signal to make that move
Sliding on moon back forward smooth
Greek entails, Aristotle and he reveals
In Egyptian crypts, pyramids as source
Alpha dominates to sigma and forever
Hand sign giving direction of the wind
Rush hour, picking arts of seeds sown
Assets in pockets of wealthy mindset
Eighteenth, the clock keeps ticking on
Waiting for razed dust to settle calmly
Wisdom planted, leaves green it grow
Kingdom of alphabets and alpha male
Across Σ making zig-zag be straight
Journey on earth, feet narrate tales
16BERLIN
Piece of the cake for merry go round
Across river found squeeze the land
Colony bound, imperialist King Qong
With machine gun making trees fall
Crossing waters Atlantic go pacific
Through Suez, with religion and law
Conference result explore to d core
Resources and its ore, not to recall
Name on sands of time warrior org
Defending shores, my kingdom call
Offspring born for peace to own all
Culture install in mausoleum on wall
An eye sore years gone, repentance
History, art and what the poets saw
17ODE TO THE RIVER
Afloat Sombreiro paddling to the jetty
Waves and sound of river show pretty
Whispers of night, lantern illuminated
Life should be blue the moon and tune
Oh my soul singing song of ancient old
Anchor to fruitful land where seed grow
Tales retold keeping history of ancestor
Of the battles they fought and victories
Reflection of the water show my home
And my father and his father's fathers
From the creeks, flowing to the ocean
An Ode to the River in Niger Delta born
Knowledge to till from swamp to land
Sacrifice as tuition for my debt is paid
18REWIND
Parse! Parse!! Broken clock still ticks
Time of no pause challenge on course
Falling dew, working to reach final call
Aroma from stew alarm olfactory road
Hassle of the day, returning back home
Love to rewind like the day we first met
Muscles to relax from your single touch
Like a baby needs nap right in your arm
And look in your eyes, whole new world
Bland you are the spice, element of fire
Passion rewind, desire spinning strong
Feelings molten it reheat into magmas
Climbing ladder from rewind to forward
Castles we make like the ones in dream
19RHYTHM
In silence but still the music plays on
Making tunes melodies stuck in head
Tapping feet nodding to metal struck
Making dance beautiful as life rhythm
Increased volume, sound to next gen
Creating steps and paths to reach in
Soul food like ecstasy mind uplifting
Conga and horn, backups they echo
Let the music play non-stop for life
Reality we're nothing without sound
Pop and blues soothing on the road
Deep Afro beats my heritage grows
Rhythm of songs meaning instruct
Making of chords, making by gods

A SNOW LION IN SPRING
Surpassed by none, surpassing none;
You climb up to the sea shore,
Your boat carried by the river to every peak
Seeing the extraordinary, you become ordinary;
Seeing the ordinary, you become extraordinary
Like a prince without a crown or cape,
You travel freely among the people,
Eating their food, living as they do;
Still possessing dominion, you overcome this:
Freed from your palaces,
No enemy can make war on you
Little by little, your heirlooms decay;
The gold of your most precious belongings
Cheap imitations of the real thing
Eventually nothing weighs you down, not even
The memory of your false titles;
The faces of sun-burnt peasants suddenly
All have the smiles of Buddhas
And the smallest weed
Completely towers over the Bodhi tree
Once there was a winter landscape buried in snow;
Now all of that is meltedABOVE LEVIATHAN
Citadels of clouds in vaporous strife
And a monarchy of blue
Laughing over these and earth
Though the cities rise up like mausoleums
Hoarding the dead
And mortal teeth of clay
Undo the seas,
Still the kingdom does not tremble;
Mere dogs cannot be rebels
Rivers of power flow upwards, always
Good servants to the invisible edicts
Which no hand has ever written, or mouth
Ever uttered
What is left of treasure when
The heart is plundered dry?
When the prisons of undeciphered dreams
Endure although abandoned
And the theatre of ego is finally emptied?
A few birds may still circle overhead
But the species doesn’t matter
The long-legged stars march on,
Devouring entire civilizations
In single stridesACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Adam Smith’s invisible hand gave me
An invisible middle finger
So now I’m giving it back to you
Congratulations all around;
We will be enemies forever, myself the
Despised poet, hideous in his
Audacity, and you the cool archons
Of literature, unamused
In truth I know how petty that sounds but
It’s fun to tease the blind, so consider
These just some mean-spirited
Pranks by the local obnoxious jerk
I could resist opening my
Mouth and be thought wise and stoic but why
Should I disguise my foolishness?
How pathetic is it
To want to seem impervious
When there’s nothing in
All of creation which is like that
Well, I guess I do have to acknowledge the
Martyrs then; unlike you
Economists they are truly humblingALBION
For David
Our man at the war’s front, a sentinel
Striding atop the
Battle-shot parapets
Besieged, beleaguered, the
Forces of barbarism
An interminable throng beyond the mounded
Bulwarks of literature;
But armored in his incunabula, he
Fights on, that wonderful
Son-of-a-bitch
Old Field Marshal Gutenberg keeps
Promising him new soldiers,
And maybe one in eighty today is worth a damn;
Still our man defends the canon, still
He holds his ground against
The artillery-fall of the Philistines
Between inferno and new life, adversity
Invasions, assaults, all of
Them suspiciously united in their outcome;
The erosion of our ancient island
Among the many bodies unburied in the
Trenches though and the
Smoldering machinery of dogma,
Culture’s grizzled warrior
Keeps his post, boldly skirmishing with
Any-and-all comers
Gorgeous Albion, green and pleasant;
Our man is watching over youALONG THE RAVELLING PATH
If you love the Buddha, you should slap him;
If you hate the Buddha, you should bow
Why pour boiling water into a hot springs?
Why carry snow up into the mountains?
To overcome attachments, just let go;
To overcome detachment, stop separating
Yet both of these are the same thing
And seeing that will overcome the overcoming
Because the ocean is so incredibly large
You may enter it from many shores
But doing so means climbing out of the water;
What belongs to the sea, began in the sea
Hence those who desire to go on great pilgrimages
Only end up treading their own skin
If they’re lucky, they may stumble on the unborn;
A journey one step forward, one step backAS ABOVE, SO BELOW
The gossip of the rain
Will not return for many months while the
Climbing summer offers up
Its lips, a cigarette ember kissing
This pool of gasoline
Heat reveals itself as the wild
Totem of madness, chaos
A rendezvous point for every psychosis
But we will let the sun polish our earth;
We can do this much
To appease that fat coiled viper,
Its ageless face
Mirrored in the red bronze of
The desert
There are no truths in fruitful valleys,
Only the snoring dreams
Unique to those mythic animals of atlas; mirages
Like besieged princes,
Their power bleeding away
Inside the starved fortresses of
Manuscript margins
Look at it without flinching, the old lathe
Within your cut-open heart;
Or, better yet, let it look upon you
Like the eye of an albino crow, inhuman
Despite its own clever hungerBUDE-AST [IS/WAS]
A response poem to Solmaz Sharif’s ‘Customs’
Both the being and the unbeing belonging together,
Feet and footprints in the soil of an
Unfamiliar country: Home
There is the (not dear) omega, the dreaded end
Premonition in all things but that
Isn’t where we’re from
Because there is no terminus for the
Endless birthing source so we
Should not grow weary with the thought of dying
Other habits are at work, a culture
Among the immortals, bizarre but energizing;
And ours, however ultimately
Allow the living to be entwined as saplings
Growing oddly entangled, their
Joy so green it {shines even in eclipses}BURGEONING EMPIRE
Overtures of orgiastic Spring –
The doom of marigolds as orioles sing
And the spectres of venturing vines,
So avid in their lascivious kinds,
Yet bring forth flora and sweet aroma;
Evenings glowing like dawns
In warmest platinum and bronze
A celestial earth crushed with urgent beauty
Where frustrated colors
Clasp each other in erotic duty
The pride of the world unfurled,
Its exoteric heart;
As all things barbaric now become
A means to shun the dark
How else would dumb profound nature
Clarify its lust and anger?
Swollen with sap and pollen, it can
Only explode,
Texturing the indescribable void
Its oblations destroy
Giving us at last the empirical and its
Burgeoning empireBUS SEATS
such that space exists to be used,
budgeted elsewhere drab and for exact amounts;
the aesthetic municipal, engineered as
cautious specification:
redundant surely against every
liable hazard (but no other)
its occupants overall, the citizenry;
average while mediocre in disruptive powers
despite riotous tendencies
liminal, however often the squalor of public vice
inverts said ride into events
uncongenial; the lottery rigged like a
bomb to certain
locations, times, accidents
minded then, stratagem steals into
our commutes
where probability goes foreseeable, all devious
position themselves advantageously;
observing those parallels
and diagonals where eyes glance
so we are given to an adjacency of strangers
pressed in, swaying backpacks, purses, phones
lantern beneath downcast faces;
inescapable, the quite random lurching, the
side to side, beyond protest,
as successive stops add accumulation along routes
where even the sun
often blunders through the windows to
jam some elbow in your eyequestions of small moral significance though
accompany these crowded intervals:
if or when to offer your precious seat to those who
appear more in need
yet if conscience can be thoroughly suppressed,
one need not trouble oneself
while the pregnant and elderly standCANOEING WITH MARY OLIVER
What the river gave back to us, gifted in the currents
Of its unusual cradle, floated past like
Trees felled in an unknown kingdom; the harvest
Immemorial perhaps, generations
Laboring under their own handed-down
Assumptions, a business
Not altogether unnatural no, but it too, gently
Drifting away, fading in connection
There is no need to paddle here, we are
Distinguished guests, welcomed
With appreciation while also tolerated; there are so few
Who just watch and listen
Our people are preoccupied with themselves
But we at least have decent manners
And pay respectful attention
Whenever our host points out some
Possessed wonder; Nature is also proud of its
Creations and we are sincere at least
In our enjoyment of these
Moments, delicate moments, furtive as the soft paws
Belonging to some shy waddling raccoon
Caught in human gaze;
The human uncomfortably near
Nature I think feels the inherent adversary
Our presence holds, even us
Their admirers, as ardent as we are, have
The essence of civilization about us; the waft of
Industry and the
Undoing of the whole wild world
Despite our tangled lineage, we are growing apartSoon the dream may end, waking us from a
Wilting shade of gratitude; the warm whisper of their
Honeyed breath evaporating
As the leisurely water carrying us last emissaries
Forward widens, like an elemental hand
Spread out in offer to
An inhospitable uncharted shore
The forest parting from us, the bay beyond;
And solitary, towering, the wall
Pale and monolithic, of a grave iceberg
As sudden as it is immense
Silence now, stretching across the entire skyCHAOS OPULENT
After the blemish and famine of winter,
Coiled coitus in the thaw of cudgeled leaves
Like thumbs, all gangly and numb
And the groping roots underground
Thick with brown murder
Shattered sea shells seed the sands
Of ravenous beaches
And the flocking creatures of carrion
Quivering with slime and translucent muscles
Nature is all a roar, brutal but
Eloquent in tyranny,
Possessing the full strength of indifference,
Which is more than enough
To waste what little life its brood
Of dreaming magicians
Sigh together in lurid flourish
However far the might of human minds
May ascend, still the
Pneumatic belligerence of the unborn truth
Will return in rapid anger,
Weeding away our surplus vanities;
All our vanities
This too is a new season
And there’s always another ready
To prowl into the jail cells of
Atrophied dogma,
To free the incarcerated,
Or just cause gongs of wrongful bedlam,
Carousing in disruption
And other sacraments of anarchyCHERRY ERYTHROSINE
Like Turner’s buoy suddenly dabbed into the sea,
Such a red to make Nature envious;
You bright thing! You perfect marvel! Brought
Into being by a mysterious means
And once ubiquitous at the pinnacles of all ice cream,
Now rare through who-knows-what regulations;
Your scientific beauty belongs to
A more idealistic age, one that could live comfortably
Under the canopy of utopia
Too bright for today, too vivid: these qualities
Remind those who rationalized their caution that they
Surrendered to drabness in fear of a bright death,
That their courage was not equal to their vanity
Perhaps you could call it atomic maturation?
Whatever the case, your memory haunts us still;
In old Warner Brother’s cartoons and Pacman cabinets,
You remain the cherry, a nostalgic ideal
Vivid enough to trouble even broad-shouldered PlatoCIVIC ANTI-POETRY
observe the discombobulated cityscape
hung in jagged planes
like the remembering of a masterpiece
from picasso’s cubist phase
it’s the defunct structure of the other
almost too wonderful to utter;
a vision of a sham dominion
broken and recycled across the system
and dread we not forget
our ornamental statues of the dead
though their vigils consist in little
save watching pigeons eating bread
thanks be to the tollgates for our trains
and a now brainless stock exchange,
we enjoy this cybernetic paradise
owned and overseered by friendly parasites
certainly it’s a life for most to envy,
spared the fates of worse-off fiscal victims;
yes our cornucopia has plenty
even though it’s skimping us on wisdomCOCOON
Astonished as I
Those who found this self
Semi crawled
From its mother of pearl sac
Livid green in limb
Yet yellow crescent eyed
Some truth to fascinate biologists
But a heinous secret from
The public
So I lived
Tested to no end
For years knowing nothing
Beyond their
Chlorine corridors and
Antiseptic rooms
All the while though
Growing into my own powers
For whatever world
I tumbled from
Was alien indeed
Concentrating I learned I could
Pass through
Restraints and walls only
Slightly refracted
Like a light warped by glass
Escaped to this day
I wander now
The broader prison of the EarthWondering at the creatures
Trapped alongside me
A shadow in their suburban enclaves
I silently drift through the
Night blue darkness watching them
Within the frames of
Large luminous windows while
They do their dishes and countless other
Mundane things
Properly disguised I feel I could
Enter into their lives a
Benign trespasser
But I don’t
Nature didn’t give me a
Mouth with which to speak so instead
I keep my distance

A response poem to Ocean Vuong’s ‘Night Sky with Exit Wounds’
North:
where the red sun touches the land the lavish war machine gives up its roots and
yet you remain something of a child of twilight anyways with the bigotry of your
adopted homeland so prevalent in its heart of white marble and limbs of serpent
coiling around the world in the sad service of what ideas no in the service of nothing
South:
you still call it saigon to spite ho chi minh or to satisfy the diaspora that surrounds
you even if you yourself are not so comically stubborn because that’s not the reality
and everyone knows this but like many things people prefer to pretend otherwise
for different reasons and a man who isn’t attracted to women certainly knows that
East:
everyone enjoys rice but in a country of corn it isn’t treated with the same devotion
there isn’t a sense of deity here as you might find in the soil of your origin but that’s
a small thing really like rice itself or corn kernels for that matter it’s all minor details
all the way down into the black stomach of hell just minor details all the way down
West:
where daylight ends and shadow comes to champion obliteration where the future
has reared its ugly head and brood of horrendous young there is a lingering youth
about it a layer of heat like a thin blanket resting upon the otherwise empty bed
and we can find our rest here if we must we don’t have to go on living not anymoreDECRYPTING A STRANGER’S GROCERY RECEIPT
When you go to the supermarket, you’ll find one
Sometimes in your shopping cart
The trivia of their lives alluded to by diet
But not only, and upon a forensic audit one will be able
To reasonably infer the number of people
That were being shopped for, the demographics
Of the household, income levels, etc
Maybe even whether they were happy or depressed
Because much of our lives is written in mundane things;
The larger record of who we are, a pile of
Wrinkled slips of paper,
Documenting these small transactions
Not many people have biographies to preserve them
But everyone is memorialized
In legal minutia, in the records of business
Ponderously amalgamating into a financial history
Adding and subtracting
Everyone into one final summary form
And yet so much is missed
I can picture the person resurrected solely from
Grocery receipts
And they are little more than a
Shambling mannequin
Crude, blurred, an inarticulate imposter
Only the avaricious of the world could mistake as peopleDIRECTOR’S CUT
I am starring in my life
I am standing behind the camera
I am
looking at the dailies
Trying to assemble them into
something
Worthy of the cost
It wasn’t a big budget studio picture
obviously
And I can’t say that I invested
everything I had
but
it was my biography
After all
If not a masterpiece then a
labor of
Ambivalent love
filled with all the
usual clichés but
still

Of course there’s the obvious
influence
of cinema vérité here
a quiet restraint
balancing the tension in a
Mundane drama

Evidence of what
You can
say nothing’s happening but
something’s
always happening

its life is melted vinyl poured into black haloes,
the recordings of noise
an apoplexy, industrialized and rococo
finance, to be contemplated, sussed out
sans discussion, the thrust of
crocodilian society being that unsaid deadliness
always ready to snap shut upon
whatever naiveté strays within range of their
ancient perfected jaws
corpses float; corpses lack control of capital
and pray to black-scholes equations
they don’t understand while in a wild hari-kari rush
to spill their intestines for
the oily waters of the exchange, the grease
a residue of glad swine
betting against
their meat-market casino

how’s this for hubris? our archives will even show
where the bodies are buried, and which
elected official gave the order
to make orphans of which children, themselves
unwanted but destroyed
more gradually; cruelty being the specialty of
those unaccountable minions
that forever thrive in the moist, caliginous
bowels of bureaucracy
above the marble columns the flagis always flown, however much it sags on windless
days; the trust
in empty sentiments too deep to be
openly discarded
there will be parades;
our disgruntled tax payers so laughably prone to
bribery with their own money,
donkeys to the last,
and each one sweating in insipid loyalty
for those, not only care free
with the whip,
but gleeful even

public healthcare won’t cover a smile
because they don’t
need you to have teeth to work you, so it doesn’t
even obligate us to go into
actuarial detail to demonstrate that
you and all your friends, every one you love,
are all just
commodified flesh
what the city lusts after is citizens bent
to an evolutionary purpose
of unregulated profit; each building
also a talon of the same monster, the mute beast
clawing itself from the eggshell of earth;
each empire rediscovering the
inescapable architecture of gomorrah
a tree is judged by its fruit
so the horror gift-wrapped in eden tells us
all we need to know of paradise;
from here the streets don’t lead anywhere, the signs tooonly planted to confuse
and likewise the words of angels, just
pieces of the same
insincere togethernessDREAMS ARE CREATURES OF THE HEART
It’s like a giant fish tank shattered
And everything inside it died;
The mess, the contents poured out everywhere,
A foul soup of sea brine and rotting kelp
As tragic things with
Fins and claws gasp in the deadly air;
An unbreathable reality,
Filling up this brand new world
You survive the disappointments in pieces,
Parts of you living on,
Adapting to the carnage you’ve become;
Some hopes and desires
Scuttling away from its aftermath
But they don’t get far
The larger the dream is, the more fragile too;
What endures after destruction though
Also endures before creation;
What is beyond us to encase in glass, beyond
Monuments of curiosity and spectacle
Whoever dreams cannot be truly broken
Because it’s dreams that fall apart,
Just dreams, a nothingness undone then but a disaster
Undoing nothing;
Illusions swimming inside an aquarium,
They were never
Actually going anywhere
Death sinks away into the earth, erased
As the heart beats onEIGHT AND A HALF
Control and out-of-control and the
Question of control
Let the director work, that procrastinator
With his delicate sensibilities
And a life crafted out of fantasy
Where the whip lands and the witch dances,
There the loins are throbbing and
Control is a part of that and so is all his
Irritating equivocation;
But he’s smart enough to flatter the money
And that’s got him this far at least
Which is rather far indeed
Not quite where the rocket ship would take him
But then he’d have to bring a crew
And how will he decide
Between all the people in his life?
This is a man of supreme indecision so
An ordinary man in that regard
Despite his exceptional talents and charms
He is rather mundane in many ways;
An everyman oddly enough
Fending off the dialectical materialism of his critics
While hoping for a holy cure or an
Audience with ad hoc curates
Nine months it takes on average to be born
So, we must admit, Guido is closeEMPTY PODIUMS
Between wiping the mirror and
Obliterating it, no difference;
And the dust that falls isn’t even real
So there’s no need to forget it
When the father doesn’t recognize their son,
What’s that? The one
Put in charge of the rice
Spills it over red clay
And so the crows fatten
While the donkey’s mourn
A forest full of shadows, live things
Tangled with dead things
The four fingered hand of a musician
Not playing the lute,
Not held out for stranger’s coins;
Busking, a poor profession,
Becomes absurd for the one who inherits
Keys to a treasury
Acting to write the record
Was in profound accord
With acting to burn it
Do you see?
Green mountains rising from the ocean
All the way to the horizonEMPTY SPACES
There’s an absence they share, the solidarity
Of people and things
Inhabiting places of despair –
Decaying high rises
And elderly residents who remember
Back when the neighborhood
Used to be better
When the summer heat wave descends,
Like a clamp on the brain
Erasing idle thoughts,
And the stench of garbage cooking in dumpsters
Obliterates all our wants
Dirty window panes dividing
The crust of urban factories from a bedlam
Alive in the streets
Glass that splinters at the rage
Unleashed in impeccably aimed rocks thrown by
Wild children playing in abandoned lots
There’s nothing in that syringe
Pumped into the mangled arm of the alley
Clairvoyant who sees
Past the abyss beyond the flesh;
Nothing in the school budget
To teach them the stars
Hidden in blackened skies, nothing
In strained conversation
That suggests a resurrection
The amber light of ghetto-labyrinth night
As heartless as a census bureauYou can bleed and scream and die
And still not be counted;
There are rabid dogs barking at the darkness
While evangelists weep on the radios,
There are televised scholars
Praising the country’s financial markets
But all of these are zeros
Words making their entrance where
Withdrawal has transpired;
Where the train has already left the station

How the world appears is always in conflict
With how the world is; the how
Of brute actuality
Now obviously I know this, being
Able to articulate it with so much facility but
Still, I am too quick to judge others;
Hydrophobic almost
In the baptism of justified blame,
Like my sense-of-self was
Some advanced
Synthetic material, designed in a Swiss lab
To be impervious to accountability
We are the cashiers of our own lives, confronted
With the converging queues of
Events and people, each as much an equal
To us in their own greedy insistence,
So holding oneself
Responsible has to compete
With that and
The hideous chore of this;
Here our rewards are simply too
Oblique to measure
Plus I myself have an artist’s ego, that dirigible
Unique to unimposing skies where
Hurricanes solicitously refrain to tread
While the scissors of fate
Pause with indulgent curiosity
What is pride? A mask of green flies
Jostling over my placid faceThe curse
Of an abundant confidence
Because, in my heart,
There is no space for the dissent of others;
And maybe this predetermines the rest,
The polite superficiality
Born of an impassible gulf
Only vaguely
Present; a quality lingering
Behind the irises
Honesty is usually
A gruesome search party,
Strolling where
The terrorist detonated their suicide vest;
Scraps of human meat, childish
Meat, flung against
The blasted walls and everywhere a new
Quiet horror to absorb, except
Here you are
Both terrorist and victim
So it’s easier to be clinical, an examiner
Of the cellular structures of sampled epidermis,
The vegetative principles
Governing an unknown animal body
Everyone prefers
Playing doctor to playing patient
Because the purpose of
Pretending is to escape real life and
In reality we are, all of us,
Grappling with our own sickness;

I’ll confess, I’m sometimes jealous of people
Who kill themselves
The way a failed athlete might
Resent an Olympian
Or someone who played the lottery for years
Finding out their neighbor won it
Death is just easier for certain people,
Especially for the unimaginative
As hard as it must be to slice open your wrists,
What’s that to the wheel of Samsara?
Being extinguished sounds fine
But why would death work out so nicely?
It takes a certain amount of naïve optimism
To kill oneself

Disgusting enough, the eye

Caught in a frozen and unflattering coitus

The obscenity of a basic existence extending
Its unwelcome body into
This already hostile universe; please if you
Could just restrain yourself

A gift of sorts,

And, after admiring
The label of the brewer,
I open it with a
Satisfying crack and take my time
Enjoying it
I’m far from a connoisseur of alcohol
But I can pretend
And immediately I can taste
The crispness

As reptiles in
Humid paradise
Look, here is one now, licking his eye
And grinning because he has
No predators in this
Place, this safe research facility
So too his human caretakers
Bathed in neon lights
During their practicum excursions
The work is magnificent
Because it is relaxing –
Allowing the mind to drift outside the body
And orbit curious notions freely,
Lingering where it will and
Testifying to a single trivial axiom

And there I am on trails
So wonderful at dusk and folklorish like
Ancient Germania
Down the cliff beside me, great
Grandfatherly trees, dignified with mossy beards
And the attentions of spiralling vines,
Gladden my tired heart
While the sky above lies divinely nested,
A celestial robin’s egg
I am alone in nature’s cathedral, left to admire
Exquisite things authored by
Plans so imperceptible they become
At most dim suggestions
For those willing to descend into the depths of time
And ladle out some draught of mystery
Nothing in this place goes unreclaimed; new life
Everywhere offering
Lessons in subtle form and silent

I belong here and with such ease
Hiking joyously in the last light of sunset as
Darkness follows at my heelsGOING TO WAR
Office papers littered the asbestos-dusted streets,
Ghosts in a phantom landscape
As baboons jabbered and salivated across
Our wrath-colored airwaves,
Its titanic gears began to turn and the
Earth shook as it rose
Behind the usual euphemisms of defense and justice,
There the urbane
Avatar of cannibalistic Nature, with those
Dazzlingly red teeth and claws,
Smiled in exultation; adjusting its Hermes tie
Briefly too before using
A huge pair of golden scissors
To cut the glossy ribbon at the opening ceremony
For tomorrow’s new abattoir
Since then, how many legions have we
Sent sprinting into Tartarus?
And we protest our own invasions and denounce
Those of our geopolitical enemies,
Heedless of how many
Hypocrisies we have to commit
While doing so
Power and wealth are just
The plastic pieces of the game, but the prize,
The real prize, is the bloodletting
Gurgling: the great stomach of the universe
Churning the ocean to carnage, and us riding out in
Fish scale like chain mail;
A tide of paladins marching into the seaHAVE A GOOD LIFE
I guess we’re not meant to be
Anything to one another;
That’s okay
You will join the people I remember,
The distance of time
Preserving you as age takes me
In its warm hands, melting
My youth like the icicle
Hanging off a low branch, a dripping
That finally diminishes
Me into something unseen
Beneath the earth
Somehow my smile will live on
Underground though
Waiting like stars in the great void
Above, a discovery
For alien travellers passing through
Forgotten constellations;
The toppled ruins of my arrogant thoughts, a man
Insincere enough to believe in dreams, but
Poisonous with reason
Fortunately the past is not
Really susceptible to our analysis;
It hangs there, fruit in Eden,
Full of the sweet hope of the unknown but
Without any real flesh
What’s the opposite of carpe diem?
Sometimes the first farewell is the last farewell,
A shadow falling across some display
In the museum of the mindAnd even though the ocean growing between us
Will never let us reunite, I wish you the bestHEALTHY THOUGHTS
Real depression is when good things happen
And you’re still unhappy
So maybe I’ve never been depressed
My mind tends to be rather appropriate, deferring
Politely to circumstance; I don’t
Laugh in winter or weep in summer, my moods
Seem correlated to reality
And indeed
There is a mechanics to the mind, one gear
Turning another, the chains
Of cause and effect transforming through their
Various transactions, rendering
This or that input
Into this or that output
It’s a kind of equation balanced by the
Weight of the dead; a sieve
Distributing portions of meat to salivating jackals
Whether or not you will survive is
Beside the point, the world exists to unfurl itself
In a reverse origami of destruction;
All that was contained
In the perfection of its beginning
Subject to ultimate attrition
The real qualities brought forth, their limits
Demonstrated beyond any doubt
And only the deluded left to linger in letting goHOMEWARD WEST
The yellow walls of the morgue
And vines budding
With a many crimsoning of labial blossoms;
Novel these, seeking
Hairline cracks, the paint
Peeling away
And an eggshell skin beneath;
Its flaking secret the
Blank message, emptiness
Evening light touched by a subtle
Glass haze, has a
Perfume effect; adding
Visible sensuality
And air as ether, an optical poetry, a mortician
Beautifying the deceased
Two lazy flies circle each other
Under a slow spinning fan;
The sweating of inanimate objects here
Is noticeable now
And a tray with scattered tooth fillings
Sits out, invitingly
Feigning the supposed accident
Of a grandmother’s hard candies bequeathed
To disinterested guests;
The offer
So trivially awkward, but
A trap nevertheless matching the
Frontier décor
Tumbleweed solicitors would knock politely here
To make questionable offers
But they have neitherPurpose nor hands, so they just
Roll along
Observe the coroner’s desk, its several
Coffee rings
And jumbled papers and an
Opened pack of cigarillos, one protruding
Prominently but no coroner
Or any sign
That they’ll return soon;
Despite this it feels like people will be
Arriving shortly
A newly puzzled queue, paralleled in underworld
No one has ever died in these morgue rooms;
But the dead will come, all of
Them made strangers, to share this
Last stationHOW TO DOUBT YOUR OWN PESSIMISM
There isn’t a trial in this world
That can defeat a genuine Zen monk
When I look at my troubles these
Are simply a mirror for my attachments;
If I listen to myself, I am told
That it’s really not a problem to die
To live in disgrace is no big deal
But only an ugly face on an inflated balloon
Stop blowing. And then it all shrivels
Up and flops to the ground
Control being the inward truth lost
In the outer, a carnival of
Fun house mirrors and you say
“That’s what I look like” quite obliviously
So laugh at my most depressing
Poems, they aren’t
Half as cataclysmic as they try so hard
To seem, but deeply lesser thingsHUMAN MATING RITUAL
It’s usually the man
Not always
But most of the time
Yeah, most of the time
It’s the man
Someone has to make the first move
And the majority of women prefer not to;
Who can blame them?
So let’s say you have this guy and he’s attracted
To some girl and now he
Has to come up
With a clever way to get the woman’s
Interest
And that can be nice
Or it can be cruel
Depending on whether the man in question
Has any respect for the opposite sex
Because, yes, people are selfish
But not everyone thinks so little of others
That they use them
Like cheap disposable packaging
But some people, sure
Some people will do just that;
Some men see women as tally marks, bragging rights
And some women see men
As just a practical means to an end
And here we have the simulacra of
Relationship;
The makeshift figment occupying the absence
Of an actualityBut more often than not
The fraud is a shared thing because
Both people want
What they want and both
Tend to be willing
To deceive themselves and each other
To gratify this
Understand the desperation here
Underneath the ideals of society there’s
A bleak competition
Eager to take over our lives
But let’s say we’re talking about someone civilized
In this case,
A decent man brought up
With a healthy attitude towards
Women;
What will he do?
Befriend her? Maybe, but certain
Friendly gestures can convey the wrong message;
Seduce her? Maybe, but certain
Kinds of seduction only work in certain contexts
So, the most important thing here is
He has to adapt himself
It’s always a dance, even if they’re not dancing
(Which, incidentally, is why dancing
Plays such a prominent role in mating rituals)
Generally, he has to show her
He can respond to her
In a variety of ways which will convince herHe’s able to fully meet all of her
Needs without losing his own autonomy to her
Because most woman who want a man,
Want a man who can stand on his own, because
Why would you want offspring
Who could only function in couples and
Not singularly?
Yeah, our genetic histories have opinions, right,
But they don’t have the final say;
So the man chooses her
And the woman chooses him
Until, finally, all the preliminaries are done
And then, you know, they have sex
And the ritual endsI MUST GET TO NINEVEH
There’s no more joy
And delight now also; a deprivation,
Like music, all-too-tedious
Where a thorn draws blood, there your
Passage has been marked, these signatures
Yoking you to that chance
Locality, articulating in the wilderness’
Own muted way, a kinship
Remembered only by added artifice
Intestines identical to city streets, bones laced
In their vaults of pink flesh
Where the gold-leaf of saints has no
Place and the people are the yellow of grasshoppers
Vying in dry pastures
Cu-nei-form of clay until the Lord’s crown
Brought forth an empire of
Sacred banquets; much as a river flows
The words of delinquent priests
Hocking whatever popular god was in season, though
Always subordinating myths to politics
But, let the living eat the dead;
Allow the owls of the desert to spread their wings
In the blue tinge of starry darkness
Though I might delay in taverns
And the establishments of the human cuisine
It is only the contrivance
Of delay; a means to suppress
My unsatisfied fullness but, every evening
The dust of the road leading out of town remains
In its taunting cloud and I know, one day,
I must get to NinevehI’M FINE, ARTIST UNKNOWN, OIL ON CANVAS, 3.1 M X 2.2 M
The firefighters are in full gear, and solid and composed not just emotionally
But by artistic arrangement. The way a Rousseau might be,
Although less surreal; rather art deco-ish actually. They are crowding
Into a small white bathroom, one indicative of a bachelor suite
And this consists of a mirror and sink and toilet, with little in the way of personal
Effects, a fairly generic bathroom then, depicted in a slightly unrealistic manner.
No, not really an art deco painting to be fair. The similarity limited to
How the figures relate to one another spatially. The bathroom itself flat,
Bland. Come to think of it, the palette and style are reminiscent of Otto Dix;
Or at least that one painting he did of the pudgy doctor. Except
The firefighters of course; the contrast there between the pale pastels,
However off-white, still circling around the drain of whiteness, and the yellow
Reflective bands on the tan fire jackets and the black fire helmets is striking.
There is no energy though in the way they are standing around; they seem baffled
Almost. Or nonplussed maybe. This is just another call for them, after all.
And the cause of their showing up is unclear but in the bathtub
Below these life-sized firefighters, the three fully-bodied and the one peering
Into the bathroom from its open door, there is a man with skin almost as white
As the porcelain of the bathtub itself, and more white than the tiling
Behind him, who is lying up to his chin in the red-stained water. And his paleness
Has its obvious source in the implied bleeding and implied suicide and all this
In the lower fourth of the frame, giving him that much more contrast
With the looming firefighters. But there is a defiance in his eyes, even with
The obvious tiredness and the clear urge to die, which explains the awkwardness
Perhaps of the emergency responders, who are not acting in accordance
With standard procedures so this must be some sort of dream, real or not a thing
Dreamt up by the artist, and there is no way to tell if the artist identifies
Themselves with the suicidal man, the intention of the painting lost by its being
Joined to the anonymity of the painter. Considering the title though
It’s clear that the dying man has halted the aid of the firefighters by refusing this
And they are, however briefly, flummoxed and so we have an expression
Of deep determination. There is something rather amphibian in how content
The man is to lie in his own blood, the red water awfully bright, because clearly
He cut himself quite a while ago and he’s been there, waiting so impatiently
For death to fulfill its half of the bargain. Feeling he’s owed that at least.INCIDENTS INVOLVING COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT
Passenger jets
Dissected in the air;
Twisted fuselage
Peeled apart in arranged bas-relief,
Human cargo simultaneously
Entering and exiting
Flames rushing down the inverted aisles,
Stewardesses serving coffee
And the newspapers in Tokyo and Leningrad
Fill their pages with the same debris
But where the families of those on Flight 182
Wail in the aftermath of terror,
Those on board Flight 004
Clasp each other
With astonished gratitude
Hijackings in the cockpit,
Decompressions in the outer troposphere;
Prayers over a tangled rosary
Offered to Our Lady of Loreto’s ear
Traffic control and its vector symbols
Like the flies harassing
Luggage handlers on the tarmac,
Like the search lights
From military helicopters looking for the
Mountain wreckage, like bodies
Blasted into freefall by an unknown bomb
Exploding down in storage
The dead collected in plastic bags,
Wheeled past their living selves
Saying their goodbyes at the departure gateINHABITANT
Could it be that, somewhere on the clotheslines
Of the past, what we hung up
Wasn’t just another persona, but rather
Our genuine selves
And so the intensified void we find
In the closet today is indeed
Explicable that way?
The houses we live in are things of rotten memory
And wishful memory, tucked away
In the corner of some cul-de-sac where the
Fingers of strangers are
Banished with metaphysical rigor
There’s nothing to worry about as we do the dishes
Before sitting down to eat
Which dirties the dishes and then after
Washing these dishes
Before having another meal
And the continuity
Of this endless cycle remaining
Perfect
Absolutely perfect
There’s a rotary phone on the table that never rings
But you could call someone if you wanted to
Pushing the lawnmower over your grass,
The chlorophyll scent in the air
And the noise overwhelming

Errantly in the blades and no
Evidence of carnage is left behindThere is music coming from the garage though
Which you can’t identify
And it’s your garage but you didn’t
Put it on, for the life of you
A mystery like the thing in the mirror that
Looks your way whenever you
Summon up the courage to gaze at it
And how is it even possible that this isn’t you?INTANGIBLES
Ever the memories of summer
Reminding me of
Simpler times, more innocent
Joys, occasions;
Eating treasure from a farmer’s market,
The green stars of the strawberry crowns
Discarded and floating in the pond,
Gently spreading
Away from each other
Life was a feast for the heart and the
Birds were all precious;
Why even our grandparents didn’t seem aged
And didn’t the circus actually
Come to town then?
Or what were newspapers except
The blindness of a father
As you fed scraps from your breakfast
To the dogs under the table?
Looking through the gaps of a
Fence at strange adults
Passing by in your neighborhood,
Each day was a mystery
Ready to blossom into adventure,
Because we were never
Called home before the sun
Went down
And so we never knew
A lack of freedom
Do children today still dream as we did?
I’d like to hope soIRON WORKER’S BRIDGE
I.
There at the high arc, the land
Surrendering itself,
Unveiling the humbling valleys beyond
Where mountains gather
In the refutation of human supremacy
Even now, the conquest of
The river still feels uncertain; though
Soaring engineering lets us
Walk above the waters as if welcomed
To the sky itself,
We are but trespassers in heaven,
And the constant and furious
Winds remind us of this as the metal
Trembling under our feet
Strains from the burden of our ambitions
To what? To nothing less than
The access of all things
Included in a last material empire
For this alone were the
Bones of our sons in past generations
Reduced to powder
And their flesh into leather; for a dream
Of power, a saddle on the
Minds of a few barons of industry
II.
June 17th 1958Tasked in the glare and the heat, where the air
Tastes like dust and the menacing sun
Drains reason and fortitude
It is an enticement to delirium, a mirage
Offered by the blue void
That seems so close to the workers sweating under it
And them precariously separated
From the world below,
Elevated to a dangerous arena where
Most days
The peril is thwarted
Not always though, not always
A crane yearning to join pieces of construction,
Swinging a fifty-five ton steel beam,
While a team around it
Labors on in the latter part of their shift
And so absorbed, disaster avails itself of opportunity,
Multiple spans collapsing in a betrayal
That causes the ground to
Plummet from beneath the boots of seventy-nine
Unsuspecting ironworkers,
Falling with startled shouts of fear
Consumed in the general thunder of the
Loud and awful crash
Seventy-nine bodies tumbling in emptiness,
Vast fragments of building
Doing likewise and
The horror of it suspended for a
Moment between the
Opposing principles of earth and air,
Between force and absence;
Seventy-nine men, young and oldAs they strike the river, it explodes
Gushing with each portion of the catastrophe
Before swallowing them
Some of course die right there,
Bent like rag dolls in the ruthless collision,
But others survive the plunge,
Even touching the bottom of the cold river before
Struggling upwards through a dim chaos
And among these many
Make it to the surface, but a few do not;
The means of their own livelihood becoming
A deadly encumbrance, a weight
Drowning them among the sinking ruins of
Their broken work
Concussed, the ragged survivors
Bled and coughed as they clung to debris
And waited to be rescued;
Amazed to be alive but still too overwhelmed perhaps
To give much thought to gratitude
In all, nineteen perished on that summer day
III.
Decades afterwards the long-ago-completed bridge
Was renamed in their memory;
Not for the sake of the ghosts who dwell there
But to appease a public demand born
Out of a sense of debt and the
Need to acknowledge the sacrifices
Made by their predecessors
The monument erected at its southern foot howeverMakes no mention of the slander
Against an engineer who died in the tragedy,
Someone convenient to blame,
A fault sanctified by a royal commission naturally eager to
Absolve the corporate partners involved,
To protect the wealthy
From their rightful liabilities
Such is the way of civilization, a thing of lies and myths,
But it means little to us now that
All the immediate consequences are gone
And the bridge endures
Without a trace of blood while
Existing for itself
Once created, the creation acquires
Independence of being
Here however the existence in question is
Welded with the acts of the dead;
Though a hundred thousand travellers use the bridge daily,
They cannot claim it in a
Manner equal to those that died,
They can only pass over it,
And so the bridge remains the property of the
Fallen ironworkers
And will always be theirs as long
As it standsISOLATING
Light creeping in through the edges of
Covered windows, the
Foreignness of its presence
Dawn and dusk are molten things
Melted into one another
Meanwhile the coolness of a flickering television
In the darkened room is like
Reason, disintegrating but faintly alive,
Amid the rising tide of full delusion
A silent pantomime of muted faces
Mistranslate the pain
Aching in several limbs at once
A return to the primal suffering of reality
What you are is nerves
Knotted together in temporal flesh,
Bones in the process
Of being worn down, like
Blackboard chalk
Each thought a trail of fine dust, a
Soul aerosolized in a series of hacking coughs
All pieces of life, floating
Into broken parts
Fraught in the humid air above a legion of
Invading wildflowers
Or the gleam of some deadly
GemstoneIT FEELS LATE
Not the hour of a heroic turnaround,
Or any other
Uplifting cinematic climax
No matter how much I encompass
These are all dying things;
However whole
They seem, however enduring
Still eroding away, invisibly perhaps
But the unseen losses
Adding up as my time drags on
Dust assembling like armies
On the tops of untouched furniture,
A tide of miniature
Witnesses gathering in sullen duty
To watch the theatre of a
Dilapidated man
If you could wander through the
Conclaves of my heart
You would find a factory there, abandoned
But full of rotting crates and
Piles of shattered wares,
A porcelain genocide of inanimate lives
With blank
Mannequin faces, devoid of
Expression, but somehow managing to convey
The frustrations of never
Really breathing
The unborn,
Suffocated by their placentaKINGDOM OF MORNING
Body of Christ
Alive in the night;
A throng of stars
In the blue beyond
Bringing on summer
And the high tower
Where the shadow holds its vigil
Over the world below,
Just another small thing
In the whole of creation
The tree of life spreads its branches
To the ends of the universe;
Aroused with flame
It ladles out mountains and rivers
From the hidden abyss
It’s even crawling out of you as well
As the vines coiling in your heart
Bloom through the skin
And the raging powers of resurrection
Sweep along the purging aeonLANDS OF TIME AGO
We’ve gone down into the
Molten core of the Earth together,
Engineers inside
A groaning submarine
These memories though don’t touch us anymore;
Like aged photographs
Encased in dusty glass they stare back,
Lifeless relics to the last and
Whatever electricity once existed between us
And them, has died a ghostly death
Leaving behind only
The flatness of the image
There is no art in duplication,
No volcanic epiphany to astound the mind
Hitherto complacent
And so like the incisions of petroglyphs forgotten
On some weathered rock, our paths
Met and marked out different tangents, but stagnate now
Upon the steep mountain
Of an eternal unbecoming; tectonic principles
Churning ground like an old man’s spade
While he’s lost in thought
Among the autumn of his garden
Vistas are we perhaps; expanses of conjoined continents
Divorcing by the silent millennia of inchesLITERARY TESTAMENT
When I die I want my work to thrive;
A thing freely available
To anyone who desires to read it, not some
Guarded treasure hoarded by an
Affluent intelligentsia
As long as they don’t alter my text or
Insert some hideous foreword
At the front of my books, any foreword really
Since they’re all interruptions, then they
Have my blessing to give away
Copies of my book for free, physical or digital;
And if my estate has a problem with this,
Know they’ve exposed that they’re
Just loathsome
Squatters on my legacy
I will not delight in subsidizing anyone’s
Passive income when I’m dead;
Let them write their own books if they want to
Try and live that way
Why should these hazard less than I did?
Of course I cannot claim ownership over
Any of my inspirations;
Each good word was a divine gift
Of which my sole claim is temporary custody
Over a small part of the commonwealth
Because true literature is born
From orchards planted by past artists;
So, in the spirit of solidarity,
Let these few creations belong to all
In the ancient pact of civilizationMATISSE
Such savage colors! A swarm of pigments
Ready to crawl about on all fours
Howling hues loping aside the river banks
And snorting with bloodlust;
Feral hounds
Scavenging for any hint
Of plain canvass
But this is the prison-break of refreshed
Civilization, a prism unleashing
Emotion from its classical monotony
Form torn in half
Like loaves at a feast of love;
Manners discarded
Into an unhinged yawn as a restless age,
Gifted with a talent for mood,
Undoes the accretions of centuries
And returns us to our
Natural origins
Anthropophagi of their forefathers,
Full of new expression
But then the eyes smeared away, the void
Where lovers were joined
In an ineffable connection of kinship;
New and familiar
We have evolved under this regime,
The avant-garde
Of yesterday delinquent towards its children;
Redundant generations
Dancing after money and provenanceBefore being
Flattened by a fallen Parnassus
So not really primitive, no;
Something else instead, without dimension
In a reversal of sculpture
Unshackling intensity to the point
Where bones disintegrate
A residue of modernity mixed
Into the vying brushstrokes of a vain palette
Paint dripping from the pillaged materiel
Of ancestral graves;
The rude artist straddling history
In their red-stained atelierMAGNOLIA STELLATA
Something beautiful, something
Whispered
Rays of delicate stars, pale as the
Shy smiles of innocence,
Make their heaven among the branches
Divided together, floating along
A river of dreams; the
Daughters of Honshu’s heart
Sweet with promise
Nature has long ago finished its work;
The seed, formed and complete
Our brief hours and briefer years
Reveal the roots of
Creation at its most ancient;
A power, original beyond any
Mortal wisdom
So the falling petals of the flowers
Are also birth, indeed the
Birth of elements quite immortal
Gathering upon the earthIX XI
This illuminated face
Mine alone
Mirrored in clouds of dust,
The toxic exhale of a slain millennium
A wail of molten metal
Trickling down the broken carcasses
Of felled concrete, giants
Pulverized to unrecognizable ruin
And the bewildered
Wandering in fearful silence

Headlights briefly slicing up the black
Window in bright triangulations;
Auras of passing traffic, the ghastly blue a
Sudden presence, searching almost
And the window a barrier
Between myself and a tertiary exterior:
Me, my body, my apartment, the world outside
Like an action figure in plastic packaging
I am still technically new, but
This newness doesn’t hold back the obsolescence that
Began at the singularity of creation;
It’s irrelevant to be new when the imprint
Embedded in the unseen part of you no longer
Speaks to anyone, the language
Itself forgotten or excised
As part of the civilized program of
Obliterating the past
Since you were not there at the beginning
You will not be there at the end
That I am now is a kind of Dedekind partition;
Infinity itself divided into a before and
After me, in both directions
The endless expanse of my nonbeing
However concrete I may feel in this moment
It’s as ephemeral as anything else;
Maybe my reflection
In the mirror is my real self
A trick of light, my true essenceII.
One can imagine the bulging circus tent
Billowing at the end of summer, the roller coaster
Already shut down for the season
While the carnies have a famished air
About them, and there isn’t
Really any desire to gaze into those gaunt faces
Because you’re only liable to find something familiar,
So you pay for your ticket with haste
And head inside not quite
Sure what you’re going to see and of course
It’s less impressive the closer you look
But the mirrors cannot be sneered at because
Doing this you are simply
Confessing to self-repugnance
Malice is the forefather of our anger
And this from the corpse
Of our own beauty; a trauma of carrion flies
Pixelating the dead as a matrix
Composed solely of ones and zeroes

Could the algorithm of the rain drops that
Gather at my window tell me
Something of future droughts? No?
Then what is the difference separating this
And any event we capture
On concocted circuitry? Although there is
The illusion of less crudeness, still our attempts to
Preserve anything are all ultimately futile
Which suggests then that
There’s still some kind of lesson
Humanity has yet to learn: hereMovement rearranges the universe however
Inconsequentially, but no matter
The disorder of the game board’s pieces
The setup remains the same
And the goals of the players, competitive or not,
Must abide by the old parameters;
Your children need never
Place flowers in your rifle barrels,
Freeze these at the instance of an execution
And the flames are better and brighter
Life is a vacation away from your real home
While your honesty is the bullet
In the chamber of the revolver pressed against
Your temple, like some casino machine
We-who-are-tired return to it over and over;
Except the jackpot offers nothing
But to be ogled by vultures, until due time
Or else there is the dream pitfall of becoming
Another demigod, the gulf between divinity and the
Cloying madness of schizophrenia though
Not all that great, once more
These dreams cannot survive waking
Like an antenna in a storm, the signal garbled
Due to atmospheric interference;
And although there is not a whole lot we can do there
This is what we are erected for, the truth
Surrounding and permeating and just irrefutable:
Fear is the incomprehension of the dyingMENTAL HEALTH LURKERS
Psychologists and psychiatrists are species of spider;
To the extent I’ve personally known them
What I mean is, they wait; they only ask the
Most perfunctory questions while
Doing nothing to ensnare themselves in the details
Of your life and hoping you
Will fall into one of their own webs
It’s a question of footing:
Preferring their stable strands of silk, these
Congenial arachnids
Are consummate with patience
Against mistakes, against responsibility
And certainly one only becomes
Interested in the pathologies of the mind due to
Private acquaintance with these, the
Cornucopia of pharmaceutical ads in Psychology Today
Shouldn’t be dismissed as just
The business of doctors prescribing drugs
No, it’s propaganda aimed directly
At the psyche of the reader;
Here the larger spiders hunt the smaller ones
Me, on the other hand, I’m a slug
Slimy in my odd imperviousness to ambushMETEMHYDROSIS
Everywhere the drains,
Dark and inaccessible, like lures
Beckoning to turn
Knowns into unknowns
The rains
Gathering in the gutters,
The swirling pool
In a bathroom sink;
Liquid portions of the world, reality,
Disappearing
With a slurp
The tyrant wipes his mouth
On a stained sleeve
And as the dead succumb
They too
Melt into the earth,
Obediently
Each mortal peril an exit,
And the totality,
A magisterium of wormholes
Bodies gone,
The squirming souls arise
Water falling
Into the labyrinths of a sewer,
Pouring from so many
Thousands of openings,
Collected with
Every manner of foulnessHell is never too full
To swallow you,
Never
The torments of occult eternity,
The spiritual body
Dismembered and putrefied
Along with the physical one;
Joining the numberless legions of the damned,
Numberless before and after the world,
Ruined into pure energy
Beyond any individual differentiation,
Erased and powerless
Seeping towards the ocean
Freed of all form,
Encompassed in continuity,
Where the water
No longer has any beginning
Or end
After the
Hunting and longing,
After the
Terror of flight,
After the
Passing of the frantic moment;
Sweat
Drying on the skin
A warm sun high-above in the open sky;
Its light and heat
Descending in gentle waves
Resurrection from the suffocating depths,
Elevation to the blinding mysteryMolecules retrieved
From the vastness of the whole,
What was once
Left to gravity’s imperium
Now floats upwards
In so many
Distillated pieces
A great invisible reclamation
Evaporated, the purged
Take their places in the high empyrean;
Brief immortals
Eager to partake of something
Surpassing the sacred;
Those
Rarest truths
Behold the white host of clouds,
A mass in the aether;
Communion surrendering
To attachments
Angels they plunge from angered heaven,
Cast down with thunder
Reborn as rainfall,
Freshwater
Poured out over the land;

Endless cycle repeats
The drains
Where they always wereNEMESIS
An escalator
Lifting you above the crowds,
The obsequious mortician
Swaddling their words in silk;
Warm rain, light with
The touch of dread, precedes
A final and late
Epiphany that could have
Changed the course of your life
Years earlier
While the contesting songs of
Butcherbirds
Chime in the humid dawn,
I see you as
You never saw yourself
A riot creeping in the bones,
Grievances bubbling like heroin tar
Being readied by the flame;
The stolen portrait of a
Stranger lost
In the darkness of a forest,
The shadows
Early to mutilate
Fate plays its feline games
As one does with helpless prey;
There is no remorse
In this animal kingdom
You have thoughts of great invention,
Dreams tantalized with
A cauldron of many passions,
And yet you can onlySit down at the table across from
Your grim opponent as
He shuffles a hostile deck
How similar those who strive,
The right and sinister;
Nothing more than mirrors of each other
Meeting at the quicksilver
Impenetrable
There’s a cinema of fraud we feed,
Reels of lies collected
With the subtleties of an old
Connoisseur, something
Eager to erase the
Hard truths we face;
And in this theatre all the roles
Are ours, heroes and
Villains cast from aspects of the self,
Harpooned in momentary
Necessity, to preserve
The multitude of illusions but
You and those you hate
Are one, and
I am youNO [DUST] NO [MIRROR] NO [SELF]
Government agencies will subsidize my existence
But they won’t buy my poetry, which is
Rather aggravating to me; the two being so
Intricate from my
Own mangled viewpoint
Am I worthy? Everything I see in myself says [Yes]
But the world says [No] and
Doesn’t offer up a decent explanation
Of course I know the world is wrong but
I’ve long suspected that its posture here isn’t even
All that honest; that it’s just
Pretending not to see my talents to satisfy
Some other purpose
Sadistic? Maybe. Profound? Maybe.
And obviously my desires are the real source
Of my frustration and if I would simply
Become a [buddha]
That would solve the whole mess
But I don’t want to be a buddha, I want to
Remain human still, writing
Of the ordinary human experience with only a little
Extra genius to salt this
Whether I die or live must be equally unimportant
In a materialistic sense, the cosmos
Its own selfish thing, busy
With childish malevolence across the bewildering
Playground of its extinctions
Another possibility is that this burlesque is
Itself a kind of divine authorship;The narrative of my life
J u s t i f i e d in the councils of heaven as an
Artistic enterprise, a species of
Immortal machination
However absurd that may be
There is no higher education than this, to be
Tutored by the flog of the universe
And permitted insight into all your deficiencies out of
An overabundance of wisdom
Surplus with wisdom, its poverty soon becomes apparent

Its yellow cover was a warning I guess,
The book I’d avoided last time
But read today
With confident expectation
My frown forming unconsciously
In its first few pages;
A curious token like a storm
Building far away,
Blemishing the distant horizon but not
Something to worry about
How can literary genius just evaporate?
It’s almost like
Someone imitating themselves;
The tone and shape and
Power of the real thing lost

At the same time, it wasn’t completely

Few poems in their entirety
But I hate puzzles (Which is maybe why
I’m so susceptible to philosophy)
And, if I might be indulged the chance
To expose how deep
My own self-absorption runs,I have to admit to the
Faint alarm that
My own hard-won talent might abandon me;
Its words, a brigade of soldiers
Not in open rebellion…
Just disappearing
From my army camp, melting
Into the night
I reacted with a kind of relief then
When I came to
The part in your book where
You confided you were taking antidepressants
Well, that explains it
And what a despicable thought that is;
One, because of
How disrespectful it is and
Two, because
It betrays a common attitude to
Mental illness that
Discourages treatment.
And yet
The feeling of vindication
is undeniable
All this time, fighting it out
In the arena of my own mind, nothing to
Alleviate
The beauty of my own
Imagined annihilation,
Nothing
To dull the madness of living without
Any barricade to death’s sirensThe windows of my mind are open to all thoughts,
Those most destructive
Not the least among them
Still, it’s surprising the price I was
Willing to pay, and paid,
For the privilege of being able to consider myself
A virtuoso;
One of Hegel’s own
World historical individuals
An ambition as pathetic as a tadpole
Fantasizing about being
The king of a little muddy pond
Because the whole of planet Earth is nothing

A response poem to Evelyn Lau’s ‘A Grain of Rice’
90:
Urban in environment, the city seeps into
The mind a thing less concrete
But equally grey and the manifold neural paths
Are not unlike the gleaming streets
Where rain has spread out its pooled mirrors
For the reflection of less electric
People than ourselves, though maybe we are
Only the aftereffect of hidden forces and nothing more
– it is a kind of oracle, this world
Telling us that this or that is true and being so
Assured but providing
no evidence
180:
The prose in your brutalist stanzas can be cold
As when recounting some horror
From a picaresque youth punctuated by its casual
Nightmares; but there is heat too, heat
Feeding on the slightest twigs of experience the
Flames that crack open the dead
Trees of this world and, out of that burning bark, slither
The soft bodies of gentle newts; creatures
Of no particular violence
270:
V________ is far from New York but they are
United by the same sprawling continent
And so it’s interesting that
Updike, sophisticated Updike, has played so large
A part in your life; a distance greater than
Paris to Baghdad but far less
It may be said, in terms of cultural topology360:
I was talking to Don at MacLeod’s once and I
Compared your work to Andrew Marvell’s
And I saw the recognition in his eyes and knew that
He understood me exactly; baroque
Like late renaissance ironwork crafted for a king,
Your words so often mannerist;
A rhetoric leftover from Cromwell’s England, thought out
In the twilight of the revolution
While living in a monarchy restoredORBITING THE END
Maybe the world is already over
And us, failing to recognize this, only riding
In the last warmth
Of the deceased’s final breath?
Fallen leaves twirled by an autumn wind
But even if everything tells us time is standing still
That doesn’t mean it is
Like children in the shallows of a low tide
Building our sandcastles
With the sea somehow far away;
Death makes virgins of us all, plunging each
Bold hunger into
The perdition of a fathomless
New doubt
Silent as my lips on a sleepless night
Unmoved before the few stars
Provided me
Were I suddenly allowed to join them,
What would I learn?
Behemoths clad in gravity, colossal with it,
Though they remain its servants
So that where they touch the purest thing, there
Their stellar bones are pulled apart
Making
A fine meal for darkness
Crossing the edge of a horizon, like a
Decision, without choiceORPHANED SERAPHIM
Apples of discord, abundant with a golden flesh,
Loom fantastically
Against the ultraviolet midnight
The Venn diagram of overlapping bodies
Incandescent in its hermetics
And how fleet the serpent footed who tread these
Lands of dream, hustled by
The soft anguish of dismembered vows;
Priests of glass citadels
Brought together in broken bouquets before being
Cast aside their father’s tomb
We are the judgement and the litigation, creatures
Invented with devious purpose
By the dark hands of a sullen craft
Freedom, now and forever,
Lies beyond the fields of psilocybin and the
Haunted mushrooms
That ignite the poisonous arias of our
Orphaned seraphim; our wayward giants crawling
Under the earth to feed themselves on
Pharaonic corpses
As the klaxons of crashing starships die
Silently in the void, as
Galactic empires rot away in the nests
Of their many worlds; the hypostatic lord endures

A redder manure; soil

Philosophers of HellOWL FARM SHENANIGANS
The wisdom of the barking Luger
Mingles with the curious peacock’s jesting cries
“In a democracy, you have to be a player…”
Like a lunatic on the bongos, the music inside his
Gonzo mind supreme in its assurance;
A man who knows
What he wants and what he doesn’t,
Unlike some rube trying to buy a new car from
Their local dealer
Shielded with madness
From the lies of megaphone pundits
And chicken-shit politicians,
He can’t be sold on the official program
A man who stands alone
On his own goddamn mountain
Doing whatever the hell feels right
Without shame, without
Looking over his shoulder to see if anyone is
Following him

Still full of joyPAPER UMBRELLAS
Plans we make with friends and loved ones, thwarted
Without malice but indifference like
A soldier from a purely geographic place
Barging in, ransacking the living room, even kicking
Their feet up on the coffee table
And grinning because what the hell are you
Going to do about it?
The rifle is the teeth of your mistakes;
Push back too hard and
This beast bucks and guess who gets fucked?
You are the bullseye the universe can
Use for target practice at any time, sporadic
In a midnight-infomercial way;
The casualness of your demise or just
Some thread of happiness snipped short by a pair
Of Moiraic sewing scissors
Beyond your most fiendish preparations
Ultimately all our fortresses are mere umbrellas
And paper umbrellas at that; things
That offer more reassurance than guarantee,
Impotent against the true onslaught
Chaos retains at its own odious disposal
Life, life is similar to walking downtown where
The sky is lightly overcast with death
We live underneath that grey haze, unable to
Effect it in any way and so
We must content ourselves, however dubiously with
Minimal protections and only our
Practiced face and
Sense of resolution to lead usOn, to sustain our faith
In ourselves, the best we can do is
Get going with our far-from-immortal business

And the names of the once separate
Dissolve into the noise
Of a background no longer of
Any significance

Snow crystals ending their journeys in the air
The canvass of a wheat field
Where we renew ourselves into some
Unfathomable creation
That’s never been seen before;
Seamless in the way
Dreams tumble through the
Uneasy mind; sorcery so effortless
It’s utterly baffling
And that’s after the epiphany
Has absconded with the comforts of
The venerable ignorami;
Not knowing is sometimes all one needs,
Life’s fruit requiring no science to
Imbibe the pith and juice

Available in excess but
More gorgeous as a secret

With which we divide

How distasteful it is to find oneself suddenly
Included in the confidences of a bigot;
The skulking sliminess of a false familiarity
And the assumption
That you would be receptive
The first thing that everyone should learn
About humanity, the most obvious thing which
Only the truly idiotic can ignore
Is that people are basically the same, everywhere
At all times and in all places
Shaped after all
By millions of years of their species repeating
The same behaviors and wrestling
With the same challenges
Organism conforms to the impositions of order,
No less us
And what do people do?
They eat and drink and sleep and fuck and love
And hate and cheat and lie and try
To be good and try to be better and all sorts
Of other things common to
Everyone regardless of geography
Or language or even
(It’s amazing that this would amaze anyone)
Skin color!
But the people who hate Jewish people
Have invented a delusion to hate
And the same thing with those who hate Arabs
And those who hate the Chinese and
Those who hate black people or anyone elseBecause it’s always some
Fantasy-of-an-absolute that fuels
Moronic prejudice
At the same time it’s not always the racism
Of people who look like ourselves
That we must be wary of;
I was in a taxi once talking to a very
Friendly driver who was
Obviously from the opposite side of the planet
(In more ways than one apparently)
And they ambushed me out of nowhere with a
Jovially vile aside
As if we, members of two of the “good” races,
Could share a joke
At the expense of a third
You never know where it will be sprung on you
And lately I’m on guard against it;
Scrutinizing everyone
With newfound suspicion since
Each stranger

And erudite observations
A tropical breeze of sorts, floating with the
Jungle perfumes of various flora
But you can sense a desire to abandon meaning here;
The heart ready to revolt into disorder
Are the bonds of gravity so abhorrent? Perhaps.
There’s a price to decorum, a weight imposed on daily life
Because, sure, being a hedonist is easy in some ways,
Like giving in to other irresponsible urges
Have you ever met anyone though
Pleased with living in slavery to their own appetites?
So control is foresight, a self-recognition of
Our own flaws and the inward shadows that blind us
We creep towards the occident
On the edge of a private horizon, peering over
Ever cautious, wary of the slightest thrill
That would tell us we are too close to some eternal longing

To the powers of cold assassination;
Quiet bureaucrats and tanned farmers being
No less the mechanisms of war, though if you
Say so you soon get labelled a bore

Who are squeamish, outsourcing
Their debt of brutality to others while

Sunrise in sharp divide, the luminous
Barracks of industry an anvil
Where the darkness is
Bent into long beams; a monolith
Broken by the bright morning
There is the presence of the divine here
As if evil, weighted with sloth, was still keen to sleep,
The early hours pristine and free of ill intent;
A quiet nearly paradisiacal
But this is not heaven
Even in its beauty and charisma, the dawn
Promises a day’s toil;
Providence, a tycoon relentless in their timekeeping,
Regardless of any moral ambition
The way the world trudges through its tasks,
A dedication by those
Who sense something, but only dimly
Humanity freighted to its tedious duties, trains
Stuffed with passengers
Bound to a thousand professions
And the lives they’re led to, ruled by logistics,
A governing terminus
Hush in its distant convergence
How precise and unstated
All this precision, paved and erected into
Fabricated edifice;
Art and worship in radiusSOFT PAYWALL
Some think there is no reason for a paywall,
That try to find a way around them,
And ruin an influencer’s attempt at monetization;
And then don’t even comment or like.
The work of reposters is another thing;
I have been browsing elsewhere
And found my content on another’s platform
Without proper links and attribution,
But they would have the views I’m deserving,
To increase their measly followers. The thefts I mean,
No one will admit to them on social media
But search the user histories and they’re there.
I let a site administrator know this once;
And as I furiously typed to them online
And messaged them the screenshots once again.
We removed the stolen content as we went.
To each the burdens that had fallen to each.
And some unsourced quotes and some full copy pastes
We had to scroll to find deep within a thread;
‘Stay on this url despite my finicky touchscreen!’
We are getting arthritis due to all this plagiarism.
Oh, it is almost like some co-op video game,
One PvE. These deletions coming to little more:
Then maybe I do not need my paywall?
He on his Microsoft PC and I on my Apple tablet,
My original memes will never go viral
And push traffic to my blog, or so I text him.
He only replies, ‘Good content makes good business.’
Banning is the troll in me, and I wonder
If I could put a notion in his head:
‘Why does it make good business? Isn’t it
Where content isn’t spammed? But here everything’s spam.
Before I installed a paywall I’d ask to know
Who was actually subscribing or who wasn’t
And the users I was like to give offense.Some think there is no reason for a paywall,
They want ad revenues only.’ I could say ‘Hackers’ to him,
But they’re not hackers exactly, and I’d rather
He said it for himself. I imagine him at his desk
Actively sifting through the blogosphere’s comments
On a keyboard, like an old webmaster alarmed.
He is an analog relic it seems to me,
Not of the internet only and modern e-commerce.
He will not go beyond his uni prof’s saying,
And he likes having thought of it so well
He says again, ‘Good content makes good business.’SOUL OF A PHILOSOPHER
A tribute to Dr. Cornel West
A percussion of tongue against teeth
In the jazz of speech;
Mouth of an unhardened heart, a saxophone heart
Overflowing with the brass notes of
Brash freedom
Life and truth and meaning
Tumbling
Out the doors of rowdy tenements
Half-painted with the blue and red lights of an
Oppressive might;
But these are the obsidian
Sons and daughters of humanity’s cradle
Laughing in lunar delight;
And he is theirs, a born orator
Strengthened by love
And the whole host of saving stars above
He rebukes thrones and principalities
But not with petulant tones
And not by shouting; allowing reason room to breathe
Because to live by a moral creed
Means you have to actually believe, you have
Set aside your swords
And bow to the wisdom of the plough
You have to plant the orchards of a future Eden;
You have to give honesty its season
And trust
The witnesses of justice
And do your part
And hope this is enough
You can’t hear the music if you’re not listeningSPOKEN ZEN
Zen is
the apocalypse in uneventful moments
Zen is the omnipresence identical to the Kingdom of God
: what Zen is defies your scrolls
and scriptures
transcending the constrictions of purely mortal reminiscence
: a panopticon for the original and genetic Om
Zen is the Dasein that descends into
the Sich, Ding an
Zen is that which the Ka’ba orbits and what
goes beyond kabbalah >
Zen is all the zealot hearts of every fallen Maccabee
and Zen is fear and trembling when the
veil of the temple is rending
Zen is kindly old monks immolating themselves
like torches and
sexualized Vedic goddesses
and corpses that are
gorgeous
above Zen there’s nothing
: not even the nothingness that annihilates
or the secretly broken celibacy of
a mahatma or even
past apartheid pariah states
Zen is the long march through a war torn countryside
and the burning radioactive dust

and always was is usSTATELESS
A poem written for CSIS
Jesus suggested
No father would give his son a snake
If they asked for a fish
But when have I asked for a snake?
And it seems as if
I’ve made do with snakes
For quite a while now; and this despite
Not demanding much in
The way of fish, really the fish
Could be quite modest
So I no longer feel as if I am a citizen of
Any country; I feel as free
As the disowned, a mercenary who
Grew up without a
Fatherland or motherland
Yes, I have not starved; admittedly
The charity of serpents
Has kept me all this time but I grow tired
Picking my teeth with their bones
These thin bones remind me of my own
And I am kept thin for purposes
Unclear to me, although
The most obvious ones still don’t make sense
Shall these bones live?
Don’t ask me, tell me because
As strange as the lands beyond the borders
Of this country look, this tooHas always been a stranger’s country
To me, a place I do not
Consider myself welcome in
Where an author’s work is offered up, there a
Literary heart cannot help but be loyal
I do not pretend to be truly good
Since selfishness has
Long circulated in my blood
But do I do much
Injury to others, such that I deserve
The animosity of anyone?
And if I have an enemy, where are my friends?
Because I will, if I must,
Make do with an enemy of my enemySTEVE’S OK
This is a real dream I had.
I’m an inmate wandering around a prison at night. Everything’s in the color scheme
of black, dark blues, and metallic silvers. The prison is also very dark and big with
interconnected towers and bridges. When I come across a guard on patrol I expect
to get in trouble but he lets me keep going as if that’s something I’m allowed to do.
Same thing with the other guards and a female cook who’s microwaving pizza. Also,
I realize eventually that I’m carrying a plastic bag, like I grabbed a small take-out
item from a Chinese restaurant. But I don’t know what I’m carrying.
Eventually I make my way outside. I’m not sure how that transition happens but I
notice it does because the light changes. Now I’m in a pleasant twilight. Maybe
somewhere like a parking lot. There’s a single tall tree and a small knoll nearby. And
there’s someone there. It’s a woman. A beautiful, wholesome young woman. She’s
in a white sundress and kneeling comfortably on the knoll. Perhaps she was waiting
there. I don’t know though.
I soon notice she’s smiling. A full smile with perfect teeth. Perfect lipstick. And her
red hair is maybe just barely flowing in the breeze as it rests around her shoulders.
We might have spoken then but I don’t remember what we said. Maybe it was
something about all the baked items. She has a lot of them laid out on the knoll.
Pies. Small ones. I lean in to look closer and there’s little printed labels on the pies.
The first ones I read say “Steve’s ok”
So I’m looking at all the little pies that have this label and it occurs to me that maybe
she wants me to tell her if Steve’s okay. That by choosing a particular pie, it will
communicate this. So I start looking for pies with different labels. Not because I
know anything but because I’m curious about what’s going on.
Finally I read one that says something different.
This label says “Steve’s in here”Huh? What could that mean? And I kind of look around confused. All the other pies
have the other label.
“Steve’s ok”
Only this one says “Steve’s in here”
But now I realize that this pie is a lot bigger than the others. The size of a pot of
gumbo and that’s when it dawns on me.
“Oo! I shudder, looking up and recoiling in horror.
And as soon as I say that, the smile instantly drops from her face, replaced by a look
of intense hatred. But not at me. No, she looks at the pie and pulls out a huge
kitchen knife and stabs it to cut it open.
That’s when I wake up.STRUCTURES OF WORDS
Is truth the surface of truth?
Or is truth the truth underneath?
Sentences connect to sentences
By joints of punctuation,
Scaffolds for the edifices of our thoughts
As we try to communicate
The things that
Always seem to be crumbling
Syntax evolving like gradual crystals,
Semantics a form and color
Uniting the long linguistic eons
And then there’s prose, purpling
With passion and
Poetry, verdant with the whole
Being of humankind;
A biome invading the terrain of
The animal consciousness
Analyze it all to the least atom and
You’ll never find truthSUMMER IS A GOOD TIME TO END THINGS
Even destruction now, warm and beautiful;
The gift of a relaxing finale
Surely this transparent silk that is night will
Fall on our bodies gently,
A fabric unfrayed since time’s own origin
And we will rise like a pool of water
Filling its new hole in the earth;
The moon overhead, reflected back by our
Motionless selves, collected
Into the imperturbable calm of a wonderfully
Mysterious thing
The unity of all those who have left their
Mortal houses, to stroll
The pleasant twilight together; children, parents,
Grandparents, made complete here
Where they have never been
More together
This is when the going is best, without
Any sad clinging or hunger;
A desire for closure whet, like a drink taken
From a park fountainTAKEN APART
The sound of your going is like
Scissors on construction paper –
A sarcasm of the breath
Which broken lungs confess
No more will we hold our
X-rayed hands together –
Each of us will walk out of the morgue
Saying goodbye to the other’s corpse
As firewood gathered in winter
We will burn our memories –
Here the old growths of passions past
Falling to a single axe
Salmon filleted on the kitchen counter
Pried of spine from flesh –
Our romance and all its sea life
A delicacy to the knifeTHAT TORTOISE!
On Xuefeng’s enlightenment
Dust cannot pass through falling water,
Twigs cannot pass through leaping flames;
And only the armor of emptiness will do
To deflect the swords of the dead masters
Suddenly innumerable realms of Samsara
Are drowned in the milk of a plodding tortoise;
Centuries ago a mountain cried out
But, even today, its echoes can still be heardTHE CHILD WHO WAS PRIZED
A response poem to Ama Codjoe’s ‘Bluest Nude’
A fired-clay now glazed with the end of adolescence;
Taken care of, esteemed and loved
Wherever her fingertips fall, the delicate wasps of synesthesia
Spring forth with cinged wings; fire following
Them out their burrows, whether wax or paper-homed.
Daylight lingers on in thimble pantomime
And theatre survives but mostly the actors just
Gather to socialize, to share those interruptions of the lines
Accidents like skies filled with floral parachutes, a falling garden
Unknown momentarily to these brick cities below
Towers, golden perhaps, where she is celebrated but
Artless themselves, ornamental in allTHE DISTANCE BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH
I.
It is not far
Less even than the space between eager lips
Not quite close enough to kiss
But there,
Eternity enters
Ships in the grey fog at sea, continuing
On their separate journeys
And where the Spring awakens
The branches of the trees again, where the
Blossoms flood their
Pale appendages with soft hues of
Awesome life, memories perch in arrays of
Dark plumage, crowds silent (yes)
But sore and eloquent
Confessing
Simply by mere presence
II.
Still, I have not forgotten her
As certain as a scar upon my skin, her impact
In my life; an incident, an episode
Though like a dried-out
River bed, when what might’ve been
Instead survives in the dust where
Real life never wasBut this began in the library she worked at
Wizened by a much earlier error
I initially didn’t speak to her,
I resisted the impulse to act on my desire
And this actually lasted for years
However often and
Obviously I noticed her
Then one day
I just needed a book; so, distracted,
I looked around for a librarian,
Interrupting
The first one I found
And she was kneeling at some shelves
In a slim sweater and jeans
And she looked up at me with one turn of her head
And smiled a smile
The universe has never equaled since
There was nothing shy in it, nothing withheld;
It was like a crescent moon
Hung in the summer night, utterly
Obliterating all the stars
Imagine my surprise to have such beauty
Sprung upon me;
Like a boar before the leaping tigress
I was struck dumb, paralyzed
And, in the human world again, the outcome was
An awkward question, a hesitant
Thank you, before
My subdued exitI was much younger then, but not young enough
Not to know better, not
Young enough to be completely forgiven
In my defense though, I tried again;
A month or two later,
After some frustrating false starts, my hope
Bested its opposing doubts
And an opportunity arose where I found her
Stationed at one of the
Help desks, alone
So I went for it, brashly approaching
And talking over-loud perhaps,
Too urgent to
Make a good impression
And now the look on her face wasn’t one
Of delight, but skepticism,
Consternation even, and seeing this
My heart drained rapidly away
And I bailed again,
Here truly deflated with the sense of
My own well-deserved failure
I made a promise to myself right there that I would
Never bother her again
But now I almost can’t help laughing; thinking how
Fortunate it would’ve been
If that’s where it’d actually ended
Because, only a few weeks later, I was walking home
From an exhausting night shift,
The dawn light rather dreamlike in my weary state
When I saw the impossible
Rushing towards me (Her, by herself)Jogging through the street,
Cutting through the mild downtown traffic to
Sidle up right beside me
On the pavement;
And I watched this as if it were
In slow motion, disbelieving, doubting
The reality
Of what I was seeing
It really felt like a hallucination, like some
Wishful thing conjured
From my own reservoirs of self-cruelty
And because of the strangeness of it, of her
Materializing out of nowhere and saying
Nothing and my own
Hindered mind, I froze up: dazed
Idiotically leaving her to walk ahead, noticing
With some confusion, what seemed to be
An expression of lightning anger suddenly leaping
Into the features of her face;
All of which I’m sure I could’ve prevented
If I’d just said something
III.
We lived in the same west-end neighborhood
In those days, so I saw her
A couple more times at random, and
At another library too
But basically that was it; that’s how it ended
Between us
Today, fifteen or so years later, I don’tThink of this all too often, but sometimes, yeah
The void of that day returns
Because it was what never occurred
Fate’s scales, so closely balanced, felt like
They could have tipped either way
And, who knows,
If I’d had the audacity just to poke her
In the shoulder
And joke that she was too good to be true
Something wonderful might’ve
Transpired, maybe
It didn’t however and, the way things have
Gone since, suggests
That the force field of true happiness
Is not one I’ll ever pierce
Even now though, weighed down upon the Earth,
I feel the nearness of HeavenTHE FOUR THINGS OF ZEN
I. Nothing Between
In the ocean
No waves appear there,
From the water
One island and another;
Separate volcanos
Feeding from the same earth,
Not a transmission
But a unity of being
II. The Shapes Themselves
Within these brush strokes
Where is the meaning?
The ink cannot know the poet’s mind
Or the poet see the ink
As it is;
Meanwhile the paper is waiting
To be transformed,
Waiting
For another
Zen is not the artist
Or what they do;
Zen is what is forgotten
III. Absence of Absence
A bowl can be filled
With anything
And if you show someone the bowl
What will they see first?So you empty the bowl
To show them the bowl itself
But still they look
At the obvious things,
At the material
The eye cannot see the function,
Only the mind can;
To see the function of the
Mind itself though,
Where is that organ?
And the bowl-ness will not show itself
If you take away the bowl
To touch on its depth,
You must empty the bowl and
Combine it
With being and nought
All that it is, the nature of all
IIII. Dust Wiped Away
Even the finest clothes
Soon turn to rags
Staring in the mirror
We may think they represent us
But they don’t
We are both less and more
Than our naked selves
So don’t look into the mirror,
Look at itTHE INVISIBLE WHEEL
I. Returning
The agency I work for sends me to different
Construction sites all over the city;
Office high rises, condominium complexes,
Apartment buildings
Today was something different though
Today the job they sent me to was
An old elementary school in
Dire need of seismic upgrades; my elementary school,
The one I graduated from nearly twenty five
Years earlier, the one I
Lived across the street from for six
It came as quite a surprise too, I knew
The address the agency gave me
Was in the general neighborhood of where I’d spent
A sizable portion of my youth
But I only realized where I’d be working
That day, when I arrived,
Five minutes ahead of time
In the dawn of a late-winter morning
The lonely brick building, now
Adulterated with tarps and scaffolding, invoked
No strong emotions in me, merely a
Strange curiosity at the
Unusual coincidence of it all
And even when I entered the school, taking a
Few minutes break from the digging
Assignment I’d been given to wander theStripped-out corridors where
I’d once been a child, the place still failed to
Arouse any powerful remembrances;
I was not a protagonist
Living out some cinematic drama
On the contrary, the hollow rooms and hallways
Mirrored my own emotions;
The basement art studio for instance,
Where children’s paintings once
Hung from clothespins on a line like
Kaleidoscopic linen,
Was dusty and empty now;
A place that stored nothing more than a
Few ladders, tool boxes, and
Electrical cords
Coiled haphazardly on the
Scuffed up floors
About the only thing of interest there
Was a few games of tic-tac-toe
Left by bored tradesmen in the thick grime
Of the peeling walls
II. Departing
The future draws us to certain points in time
And then we pass these, everything
Receding away
For some events though
The temptation can arise to ascribe them
Exceptional meaning;
An inflated sense of destiny
Taking hold as grandiose thoughts
Swell to concoct flatteringTheories of esoteric fate, the universe itself
A thing to gratify our personal lust
For self-importance
But those are just pitfalls
Illusions feeding on illusions,
Our own egos
Stretching like shadows into the world to
Darken the way before us;
And the adversary that is the heart
Siphoning life lost
As such, I recall the story of the monk who,
When his arrival was foretold
In the dream of a villager, admonished
Himself for being so
Predictable
Even a cosmic demiurge is just
Another inhabitant bound to the invisible wheel of
Fleeing momentsTHE SECRET HEART
I want to see you covered in sweat;
I want the glistening and raw
Douse the fire of my mouth with your mouth,
Boil us together
Until we are the pure bones
Of one another
And no longer suffer
Any inhibitions
Love is the death of the ego;
Love is planting yourself
In the soil of someone else
Now add lust to this
Nations surrendering to empire
Will surrender less
Than I will to you
But I will also conquer more
Your desire will crown me and
Only when I know
Your own hunger has grown wild
Will I consider myself
To have eaten
Touching your body
Like the surface of the sun,
I am darkness
I am the emptiness
I am engulfing
And you, engulf meTHE WHOLE WORLD IS NOTHING BUT PEACH BLOSSOMS
Where the mountains huddle together, you’ll find
Peach blossoms clouding the sky
Out in the desert too, the petals of the peach blossoms
Are piling up knee high
And no matter what town you visit or city you conquer,
The people there are sprouting peach blossoms
Whenever they open their mouths,
A storm of peach blossoms are showering forth
Because once you’ve seen the peach blossoms for the first time,
There’s simply no turning back
The cold ground of illusions is buried forever; from now on
Peach blossoms will descend like sunshineTO LIFE AGAIN
The luminous grey rain of a
thunderous Spring, announcing itself
A rain, cold but fresh, waking
our drowsing world
with its sharp insistence, splitting
the sky like the body of
a sombre tree to tear open the
pale blue fibre beneath
Revelation of light, revelation of time
preaching its harsh rebirth
to the dead lands of
a dying Winter; the grey empire
melting into earth
The sound of hail showering
the cathedral roof as the new
bishop in his grey robes
thunders from a wooden pulpit
Death is a heresy; the most ancient
And so I preach to you about rain, clamoring rain
that strikes the rocks and the
grey hearts of every wrecked unbeliever,
ready nevertheless
to crack like crazed-lightning
released with an illuminating life within;
the greyness melting away
as the trees become one with the sky and
life, extolling its sins,
redeems itself in sprung beauty
So honest and beautiful; and just rainUNDONE DONNE
Not as in Anne and him, as he said
But under the tonnage of ashamed death
A crumbling clod, not even
Returning to the main as each piece,
Fragments of a heart, are
Divided among their brigand triad
A wit of valid diction in the foreboding morning
While the dawn in dunce-like redundancy
Adds its insistent solicitations
To the apparition of a concubine Gaia
Stained, appalled at the wronged church’s
Imagined order and the screaming
Mandrakes, torn from the dirt like late schoolboys
From their warm beds;
As thirsty as the amorous flea for its
Sanguine lover, this
Cavalcade of cruel sighs which
Hasten on a wicked spirit
Ungainly as a shrouded camel, stumbling
Through deserts of metaphysicUSHER
A red fellow landed on me;
A frantic thing with fluttering wings
And when I picked him up
And let him crawl across my hand
He took umbrage at this and
He quickly took off again, settling
On my shirt once more; unmindful I was
On my way elsewhere
Still I was patient with him;
Still sympathetic until
Gently, I did send him away, because
Gently makes all the differenceVERMIN TO SOME
Half of them dead;
The insects I try to save
It’s my impatience, my irritation
As I attempt to scoop them
Into a plastic container I keep now
Solely for that purpose
Their little bodies mangled, twitching
As I accidentally
Slice through them with a clumsy
Edge of hard plastic
Innocent silverfish and cockroaches
Fleeing from me in terror
And I am gruff and regretful but,
Most of all, annoyed by their mild intrusions;
I don’t want to be a bastard
But I also don’t want the moral burden
Of saving little creatures
Who are absolutely not welcome
In my house
Because it isn’t really my house;
If it was, I might ignore them,
But what would my landlord think if I let pests
Roam around free?
He’d probably evict me
Still, I don’t want to hurt them
(Roaches are actually quite adorable)
So I try to do the kindest thing I can think of
And toss them outOf my apartment into the
Cold winter world
But again, I’m not even good at that;
Too often the results
Are the gruesome deaths of my tiny silent victims,
Dying their frantic tragedies
Without even a cry
And I, the heinous colossus, going on with my day
My cruelties, swiftly erased with the aid
Of a flushed toiletVISIONARY
A response poem to Solmaz Sharif’s ‘Look’
Seen as the inverse of seeing of course
you will be both; the one beholding, the one beheld
folded together now into an eloquent human katana;
a unity made of many layers; each inseparable
from the other, the strange of which there is no outer.
The heavens beyond, gone: the vapor
where once there was a dream, the dandelion
exploding into seeds, swirling
like summer snowflakes, their glint catching
our gaze; touched by light, the eye a farm cistern.
Yes the world is full of war and suffering.
Yes and we can still see farther.VOID
Not everything beautiful is happy;
There is a crystal splendor
In the eternal web of tragedies
The glistening paths where the tears have
Streaked across a perfect face
Like bent starlight
A cry on phantom lips
Rushing into the realm of daylight,
The charge of a black unicorn
And what haunts you glints in the
Eyes of nocturnal dwarves
Hammering silver at an anvil
She will not speak to you,
Not even in ravens,
So what you divine is yours alone
The secrets of a heretic’s tome,
Wrapped in the vellum of
One who practiced witchcraft
And where the trees of ash
Were planted, there
The blood was spilled
Here unspoken words, the roots that
Drank serenely from the dead,
Feeding her memory
Because sometimes those who
Are most beautiful are
The ones who love the horrorVOODOO ELEGY
A cadaver prince
Playing some twilight trombone
While perched
With dangling legs
On the crest of your
Tombstone
One of the baron’s
Own men,
Ready to serenade you
As your rotting
Body bursts like a
Blooming tulip,
Though a flag draped casket
Keeps it secret
And none of the mourners
Who went away
Saw your ghost before
They did;
Neither did they hear the
Dixie Jazz angel
Welcoming you in
You were a swell fellow,
A hell of a guy,
So the man upstairs is
Willing to wipe the slate clean
As long as you’re
Prepared
If you would breathe
The sweet air again,
And once more become
All aflameWith the bright passions
Of the world,
Then kneel down in the
Warping bayou
Imploding beside your grave and
Drink the clarifying water
Being offered
The war is over colonel;
Sheath your saber
And blissfully forget it
Ever happenedWANTON FROM HEAVEN
A tribute to the painting Made of Gold
Beasts winged and serpentine
Sunder with deaf agony
As the extortions of autumn twists them
Into purple meat; they succumb
Awkwardly, imitations
Of their former unbroken selves,
The lives that once existed
Before, plastic
Material for the orange extinction to
Plant its silent fangs
Rivals grasping, breathless of course
Ahead of the end of time;
If we are dying together though, let us
Pair ourselves in opposing mirrors, balanced by
The aesthetics of our demise:
Overall, it being
A thoughtful asymmetry
Friendship can never truly lead us astray;
Even its cruellest failures,
The art of a shared destructionWHERE IS MARSEILLES?
Nine eggs, beef:
A diet of Stonehenge arranged
In starless deference
Sleeping, travelling on ears;
The countryside suggesting parcels
Of a once monochrome
History
Green war, earth
Exploding as ghastly Prussians
Fumbled a stiff waltz
Past the fortified border, swinging off
Their startled Belgian partners
With a grey smile
Flanked by an awful pair of
Raw pink
Duelling scars
A good dog, plain as day,
Barking after
Lurking communists and other
Hidden undesirables;
Unparalleled, the aim of imperial purity
Party-head lettered
At Oxford, a pansy tourist who
Never saw action
Though and only knows it
From odd BBC
Documentaries and
Hollywood dramas;
King Jean’s dead men mean nothing

"Take hold of the river," said my heart
And I reached out with my hands, foolishly
"No. Take hold of it," my heart repeated
But the words were as elusive as the water and I
Slumped to my knees in frustration;
How does one hold that which can't be grasped?
How does one possess anything other than by strength?
But now I looked up, farther down the river,
Towards the mountain that was its source, the many ravines
And slopes where mist and melting snow
Gathered together in strands that then formed new unions
Which all combined in the great river
Presently flowing past me, and suddenly
The river was entirely mine;
It was all a thing I had created, thoughtlessly fashioned
Together from the weave of experience,
Sensations pooling and flowing as one into the
Tributaries of my effortless creation;
And the mountain was my own self,
Where the river began and descended from.
Reaching out my hand again
I cupped it in the water, because I was thirsty
And the river was mineXU WEI’S GRAPES
How do you fall in love?
It just ripens;
It drops into your lap
Maybe the day’s light is gleaming off the fruit and maybe a mist is hanging in the
vineyard
But that doesn’t matter
Beauty is meaningless
Some people want to crush beauty
Others to gaze on it without tasting
What of either?
Waters that crawl down entire mountains are trapped, imprisoned in little ponds
Still the sun frees them
Meanwhile the vines wither as their harvest is crushed
Meanwhile a man sits painting
A lunatic actually
From his nocturnal hands, night flows into ink
Distilled
He bends twilight into the shape of a farmer’s joy
Now, centuries later, I pluck the farmer’s orchard
I feast off one painting
The delicate shifts in tone and form
The grace of it all
My heart drinking his blood
Because nine is an auspicious numberYOU DON’T DESERVE TO BE CRUSHED BY THE MACHINE
If not for the work of the wage slaves
This shallow paradise of the wealthy would dry up
And vanish in a generation
They cannot lift the steel bones of their own skyscrapers
Or lay the roads for their smug parades;
Frail in virtues even more than flesh, they leave
All the necessary work to others
While posing in a limelight of command and
Congratulating themselves and their fellow vampires
On the carnage of their ingenuities
Devious, scheming; authors, if that, to unnatural things
Who conceal a simple obvious truth:
A crown adds nothing to those who aren’t idle
But the machine, yes, the machine
Belongs to them
And always has and always will;
The soulless nature of its logic, the coercions inherent
To deterministic power, ensures that any age
In which said machinery is held so high
Will burn every root for fuel
And then cry in tantrum as the forests die
Offspring of Midas, enthralled still
With the gleam of their lifeless transmutations;
We cannot rely on them
Instead, let us look to ourselves, fellow laborers
And such in fields and factories
Who have always shared our struggles, who have lived
Through similar challenges and survived
As precariously as we haveThe dirt we share is more beautiful than our
Golden leaders
Those office captains with callous-less hands,
Riders on the towers of an engine, are so often ignorant
To the suffering of its inner workings;
Sorrow an abstraction, fatigue an abstraction
Terror
An abstraction
United though, the ordinary people of the world
Are what justify us as a species;
Their bravery comes from eons of sacrifice and even if
Dormant for long periods, can always
Awake suddenly
To shake off foul empires
So open your eyes and see; you are not alone,
And gathered, you are mighty

THE TRUE MEANING OF LIFE
The years go on and on and on
Carrying the months with light from the sun
To begin a new ending
Its days and time we're no longer redeeming
Sadness and moments of regret comes in turns
Gladly, sometimes joy and happiness also hums
Some people we look up to, are below the earth
Some we underestimate are above the heavens
Loved ones and enemies have come and gone
With memories in our heads echoing like a gong
Everything rushes to end in a new beginning
But the world in laziness, never stops spinning
Accustomed to this tireless rhythm
Where we follow the pattern of the talking drum
Living our life in the season of happenstance
As we stamp our feet in the attire of cultural dance
The struggle has become a tradition
With every step justifying our religion
Faith mixed with doubt in the pursue of fate
The clock becomes an enemy, for in punctuality we're late
Our paths lacks coal tile
We begin and end our lives in iles
Dry season triggering wet tears
Raining season creeping dry fears
Driving in this old lorry of life
Where solitude is a noisy wife
4Nagging our holiday of rest
Spending our days existing rather than living
Now our old age drowns in vanity
To the past, the future is a penalty
The days old more plaques than the Egyptians
Scars on the pages of our skin like an inscription
Experience have become a shelter
With hopes making the surrounding better
Worries feed me each day
The night never seems to go away
I'm drunk with words
Ironically, with silence I build my walls
Reward or karma, one must surpass the measure of my time
For in inding the true meaning of life, I judge my rhyme.
5LIFE AT BEST IS VERY BRIEF
"Life at best is very brief" they say
A painful reality we live in, I say
Borrowed hours and moments
Debtors from birth till death
The green leaves rusts with time
Even predators, have their inish line
From childhood of smiles and dimples
To youthful beauty that drowns in wrinkles
From youthful catwalks and gifts of roses
To old age of limping and gifts of glasses
From sweet beginning of love and promises
That ends in malice or friendship and reminisce
We live in time yet have no time
It scares me how everything is temporary.
6MEDITATION I
Time is a traveler
Yet it takes no road
As we journey yonder,
Let our roads be unknown
Neither should our ways be crooked
What is mysterious, cannot be understood
What is not understood, cannot be destroyed
For humans are poison
They destroy everything they touch
Still, hate no one
Only their ways
Love all
Befriend none
For friendship breeds commitment
Commitment breeds trust
Trust breeds destruction
The beauty of life is love
The beauty of love is life
Let not their ways change you
Cause every road has its own judgement
Let your conscience be your Judge
Listen to the song from the birds
Let their music entertain you
Cause there's no melody in violence
Let your eyes see the past ahead
And know which way to go
7For in experience, we better our ways
Borrow an extra ear if need be
For in counsel, we better our days
We came naked, and naked shall we go
This is the only fashion of life
Sun and the moon are life's photographers
Do not let them capture your fears
Neither let them capture your sins
Live your life and love your life
Cherish the uniqueness of your diverse being
And in reference, applaud your maker
Be conscious of your existence
Let no fantasy steal your reality
Neither let the nightmares still your dreams
Cause everything too is an illusion
So, gather all you can
Let go of burdens
For worries delay our date with destiny
In regrets and agony, do we drown the true meaning of life.
8MEDITATION II
I sat alone in a lonely hour
Eyes ixed on nothing
Lips sealed as my thought drips
This is my meditation
As life goes in circles,
Let our actions be straight forward
Live spent on worries and trouble
Victory and defeat make us proud or humble
Our wisdom separates us
Our ignorance isolates us
When we're offered pain and anger as fashion
Let hope and peace remain our out it
Guide your path with precautions
As the mind attracts,
So does the heart rejects
And when the mind rejects
The heart attracts
For when both is conquered
We live but we're not alive
We live but forget our role
For time judges itself
Everything we've lost, inds its way back to us
Everything we've damaged, takes more from us
Truth is a map
Life is a journey
We can decide not to travel
But we'll sure meet our end
Fear is darkness
9A little light bloom’s our ego
The past is dead
Even tomorrow is not alive
The present is a survivor
In it hopes and riches lies
Everything in accordance
Breeds rest of mind in abundance
Grow life inside of you
Let your existence spread
Let your footprint heal the lame
Time makes us patient
Time makes us desperate
Time is a healer
Time also is a killer
Nothing good is bad
Anything bad is bad
As consciousness comes from meditation
So does knowledge come from realization
When everything is lost, and one thing is gained
One thing is lost, and everything is gained
Let patient and contentment be balanced
Let gratitude and humility be adorned
Be addicted to truth
For it's never enough
As the moon travels
So does our days
When revenge knocks
Let's not rush to the door
10Let's stay ixed in our room
For in it sometimes lies our doom
The more we live
The humbler we should be
For what you possess has been possessed
And what you crave, has been neglected
Continuous practice doesn't make perfect
But continuous practice with passion
The season we see shall be no more
Make hay while the sunshine
Make hay after the sun shines
For success comes with no resting time
Do not conspire to destroy
Neither be quite nor watch evil
That too is witchcraft
As we grow, still one thing marvels me
Nothing is new,
Yet life is full of surprises
Everything is nothing
So let nothing be your god
I sat alone in a lonely hour
Eyes ixed on nothing
Lips sealed as my thought’s drips
This is my meditation.
11ANTI-CLOCKWISE
The earth is wearied
Of generations after generations
My heart is worried
Of sour celebrations
For the soul is destroyed
The body is glori ied
The strong fears death
The weak is constantly set
Children gamble their cards in turns
Fifty- ifty, they cast the dice
One day out of time,
There's no more Sunday
We skip for exercise,
And skip our days
Every day is the same
Let's just play ignorance to their names
The wheel of life is always in motion
Our speed and journey, we auction
A journey of thousand miles
We're nighty nine steps ahead
A new day, as the old lorry sets its engine
Travelling to the past, becomes a future goal
Sometimes paradox plays a deceiving role
Even when the cock crows,
We tend to forget our reminder
Sometimes failure lies in the effort
The stairs get higher, the more we climb
Illusion becomes real, in a twinkle if an eye
For this kind of choice,
Destruction is the price.
12THE UNFAIR BARGAIN
We can't say no to death
It's the only game we don't bet
Everyone must go
though the grave is not the goal
It's part of the mission
Though eternity lies the vision
Body rotted
Soul revitalized
Mind forgotten
Heart remembered
On the grave side,
Words are muttered
Songs of immortality
Echoes through the tunnel of eternity
Left on the earth are footprints
Left in our lives, are ingerprints
Sailing to forever
The wild wind is a constant reminder
Thousands of ships we can't see
Floating on the high sea
Lying in a box less half a home
Compulsory humility to some
Caged from the womb
Still caged down the tomb
The world is a prison to buy and sell
We only trade fairly, then returned to our cell
In turns we exit
In dreams we exist
Laugh to the peak
Cause you'll be wiped for
13For it is a curse
To see the beginning of life
And not the end of it
The footsteps we leave,
Are being traced to were we'll be
It doesn't matter where we're laid
For we all have a resting home.
14LIFE & DEATH
Life and death,
Oldest friends without love
The beauty of one, lies in the other
The tragedy of one, lies in the other
What one takes
The other gives
What one gives,
The other takes
Where there's death, there's life
Where there's life, there's death
One cannot exist without the other
They were made together
But are not the same
Death is for life and life for death
The birth of death is life
The death of life is birth
Both have one thing in common
A rebirth
We mistake life for a better one
In ignorance, condemn death
Sometimes life is a killer
Sometimes death is a healer
They separate the world
Also, they unite the world
They destroy
Also, they build
They're both protagonist and antagonist
Yet none takes the lead role
They are inferior in superiority
They are superior in inferiority
15A fair supremacy of hierarchy
In living, we understand death
In death, do we clearly understand life
In this our conscious reality,
We embrace this warm thought
As we place judgement on our deeds
By looking at the things we don't see
And listening to the voices we don't hear `
The words of our forefathers
Echoing through the tunnels of eternity
Lingering in the ears of generations
Their legacies, benchmark for survival
Their footprints, landmark of correction
Their souls have become ancestors to life
Where death ends, life begins
Where life ends, death begins
Cause both can never be conquered
In between life and death do we lay
Amongst these losses and gain,
Do we understand the true meaning of life itself.
16BODY, SPIRIT & SOUL
For the body, spirit and soul came together
In a fair unity of disagreement
That the body is pleasure
The spirit is nature
The soul is the treasure
Body lies in confusion
Spirit Awakens in correction
Soul, a destruction, or redemption
The body owns the world
The soul owns eternity
The spirit lies between
For when one is on shift,
The other is at work
The third is constant
One bears the light
One shines bright
The other bears the burden
Body decays,
Spirit attends the funeral
Soul weeps
In daylight, one is darkened
In darkness, one is brightened
In between, the other lay
The true meaning of existence, lies in all
Yet the failure of survival, lies in one
Time judges one
The other Judges time
The third is time itself
One is faith
One is hope
17One is fate
One is earth,
One is heaven
The other is heaven and hell.
18RUNNING TIME
The cheetah runs the fastest
No doubts, time is still the best
Everything is wrongly moving fast
Future now lies behind the past
Weather losing track of its forecast
Rainbow colours, similar contrast
To Suicide, our hearts we've cast
In our thoughts, we become outcasts
In the evening comes our breakfast
To arti icial creations, we steadfast
No more honour to irst things
We need more hours in a haste
Lost loving to lust
Lost memories to dust.
19THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT
Cloud darkened by thunderstorms
Upon nature, her anger formed
The atmosphere came together
In pleasure, the world became wet
Mighty drops of rain hit the roof,
Then strolls down to the window
Windows covered with ine linen
As cold spreads in the dwelling
Eden was beautifully dressed
Eve was beautifully undressed
Eyes ixed in eyes
Hands locked in hands
Lips locked in lips
Breathe made warm the cold
Breathe seized by the moment
Left to right the fruit dangles
Salivation couldn't digest the urge
Heat strolls down and hits the nipples
Tongue perched like lies
Taste of honey rather than sweat
The tree of life
As both branches were spread
A warm meal served cold
Beautiful as it seems
20Righteousness became a sin
Blood on the dance loor,
Perfection is lawed
Hunger for death
Satisfaction of life
A healthy fruit for a dying stomach
An angelic bit
A demonic lavour
Then cums the devil
There goes eve
The fruit was seen by sin
And we became blind for seeing.
21THE HUMAN RACE
The human race is in danger
At home, we're all strangers
That we do not choose
What to be or what to refuse
We forget in remembrance
In emergency, we hate the ambulance
We're living to die
We're dying to live
The catastrophe is amusing
Women have hate, to gossip
The Barton now belongs to men
Time has failed to judge
The Barton now belongs to humans
Children are now adults
As elders forgets their roles
Devil has become a god
As false prophets neglect their souls
Our hearts are stoned
Our minds drowning in liquid
Believe me in reality or illusion
That we no longer see a sky
The cloud has taken ownership
The moon no longer spotlights
Crime is now our stage light
Shooting stars have been shot
In funerals, we live our days
In laughter the dead cries
In tears, the living jubilates
The alarm has been employed
The cock has lost its job
22The birds no longer sings,
The mosquitoes raps along
We work to breakdown
A twenty irst century slavery
We love to break hearts
A twenty irst century bravery
The time is upside down
Our ways are cruci ied
We run to destruction
For in pain lies our joy.
23A BEAUTIFUL TRAGEDY
The past echoes in baritone
Current time have gone sour
The bitterness of our existence,
Drooling over our daily dealings
Struggling to smile
The excessive waste of emotions
Nothing counts, except the coins
Praying to God, still we idolize currencies
The betrayal of self con idence
Taking us back to our vomit
Growing in foolishness
As we run from our childhood of wisdom
Where everything is done from the heart
With a little common sense to balance out morals
Youthfulness, a gambling stage of life
We either sell our souls
Or buy a permanent scar
We become lost
Then we're found in nothingness
In pain do we lose the true meaning of life.
24EVENING FALLS
Evening falls on day light
One last candle to keep the night
leaves dropping,
longing for the ground
Settling on its root
No place like home, a fair truth
Memories in the air
Life in its lair
Memories buried in the future
Death is only a seed to nurture
Colours fading in time
Beauty decayed in rhyme
A downfall of resurrection
calmness glued with tension
The stars came together
But scattered in brightness
Seduction quietly lay
In between Cold and breeze
From the ashes of rust,
Hope was born
With mere nakedness,
Stems were clothed
A joyful mourning,
A mournful celebration
25Nature has died in life
life is constantly alive in death
Night mixed with dawn
As moon embraces the sun.
26PURPOSE IS BORN
Salvation in belief
Fate and talent drowns in believe
We make our plans,
But life decides
The journey of life is beyond coal tile
As each height waved from miles
We grow in hate, we grow in love
Regret and reward applauds as time evolves
Footprints becomes landmark to generations
Generations of pain mixed with culture
We fail, we law, we realize
The true essence of life
In a bittersweet remembrance,
Purpose is born.
27LIQUID GRAVE I
Love veri ied by acceptance
No compulsion nor resistance
Believing is the only believe
Transformation to conceive
Conscious blindness of the earth
Eternal redemption is a depth
Struggles and pain to breath
When the pain and gain is death
Physical spiritualism
Conscious realism
Your fears becomes’ afraid
All because you've obeyed
Your tomb is empty yet your dead
Turns a ghost yet no one is scared
You become a spirit
That never lived in a casket
Nothing is ageless
Yet your eternity is timeless
Not all the dead will die
Not all the living will live
28LIQUID GRAVE II
And from the liquid grave
Death died in solitude grieve
No tears to lood the wet rivers
Nor sins to quilt the poor sinner
For death has done it worst
On the price list, so much it cost
That mere mortals can't afford
Tears billed from the lord
Beautiful laws from the gutter
Echoes of ode from the mocker
Wounds are healed
Eternity, we feel
Weep not your tears
But cry out your laugh
From the mountains
To the forest
From the land
To the seas
It doesn't matter where we're laid
For we all have a home.
